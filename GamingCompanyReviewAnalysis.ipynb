To my major dissappointment, after purchasing these two codes, I realised the majority of the games on the ubisoft store are for PC only as well as being a lot more expensive compared to other stores and therefore I could not purchase the games I wanted. Since then I have frequently visited the Ubisoft store to try and find games or add ons for the PS4 and today I had finally found two games I wanted to purchase. But now I realise that neither of my codes are any longer valid. I look up why this might be and see this new system in place that tells me codes expire after 3 months. This is news to me!This news has been very disappointing to receieve. Had the ubisoft store had the content I orinially wanted on the PS4, I would have used both codes by now and in quick succession. To be honest I feel very hard done by and wanted to complain. I have now wasted 200 U points for nothing. I should not be able to purchase the 20% store discount from my PS4 if the majority of games on offer in the store are not on the PS4. I asked ubisoft to advise and they sent me to the forums.No reinstating of the codes or no refund on the 200 U points. I mean I want to purchase games from them. now they are getting nothing.

arrives after 5 or 6 minutes after failing 5 times im now blocked from my account incredibly i have been blocked out of my account for similar ubisoft shenanigans before ubisoft can scam your money if you will return gameafter i create a ticket they were been marked as resolved next  i create a new one  so ubisoft just close tickets to hide a problem after 10 attemps i received a mail that i need to contact with some xsolla which is a bot  so i started to message with this bot which is absolutely not ready to solve a problem in conclusion i lost a money do not trust ubisoft not gonna lie their products arent bad but everything else is the worst poorly implemented features poor customer support and other less noticable things im very disappointed awful customer service cant unlink an account so tells you to contact customer service which i did 2 weeks ago without reply the live chat is also never live the hours it says it will beif i ran my company like this id be bankruptshocking ubisoft is bad im from india and since only steam offers regional pricing so we can get games cheaper on steam store but ubisoft pulled games off steam and even after far cry released i was hopeful but recent games mirage or motorfest didnt come to steam so same probably would be for avatars game so reluctantly i bought it off ubisoft store despite it costs twice as steam i mean literally we can get ultimate edition from steam for the price of standard edition on ubisoft store anyway i bought the standard edition but later decided to get the ultimate edition as i had always bought ubisoft games on sale on steam for very cheap so why get this standard i requested refund ubisoft sent a mail saying refund approved but it turned out that instead of putting money back into my card they deducted the money out of my card seriously never faced such ridiculous issue on steam ubisoft sucks my old email account was hacked and deleted got a new emailadress and tryed to change my emailadress on my ubisoft account that was not possible contacted customer service after several weeks i got an email to send a code i did no answer anymore i decided to delete my account and create a new one only to find out the bought games on steam are bound to the old account contacted customer support again with the question to recover my old account and change my emailadress got the same email where they asked for information i gave the information no answer anymore replyed those emails a few times no answer im angry right now and refunded my ubisoft games on steam i never coming back at ubisoft again worst support services given one reply per day keep asking for proof again and again and at the end said not able to transfer ownership of the games without valid reason seriously if i knew i need to login ubisoft account from steam purchase i will never buy ubisoft games ubisoft dont listen to their players take forever to respond when you contact the support is and have no idea what they are doing when it comes to managing their games especially rainbow six siege it is full of glitches and bugs which have not been fixed over the last years they punish you when your game crashes even if it is their mistake and they implement features that literally no one asked for so fuking bad its almost hilarious dont give these greedy fuks any more money always some fuking problem with online in

this company is terrible they dont give a crap about their constituents clearly was playing unranked in rainbow six siege and my internet takes a small dump and i get disconnected not even 2 minutes later i boot up the game again and ive received an abandon penalty for 2 mfkin daysgod i cannot begin to express how poo this game is very stupid how the game literally disconnected me with a message stating i have been disconnected from the r6s servers and yet i still get temp banned games are broken on release customer service is non existent doesnt even read the question and pastes generic answers after a week this company can improve by having more than one way to verify an account having ubisoft account linked to xbox that cant be removed or changed because original email address is no longer valid now i have a pointless ubisoft account linked to my xbox forgotten password for ubisoft so cant recover my account now because i cant access the email address from years ago spent ages on chat to be told nothing can be done i contacted hotmail xbox and ubisoft and im still stuck with useless account i cant access this setup is crap legit big dog scammers do not get uplay they take your money and if you have issues which you will your subscription will be wasted if you try contact them for help with proof the their issues they wont reply for like 12months and then when they finally reply wont help you anyways terrible customer support the game doesnt run i am getting following error there was a problem authenticating the ownership of this product even though his was my first time creating an account with ubisoftits weird steam games should simply use steam authenticationafter spending too much time trying every troubleshooting i contacted ubisoft customer support only way to contact them is by raising a ticket their response speed is 1 reply per day at the end of the day that reply isnt useful it seems they just copy paste some basic stuff from internet and give it to usnow they are not replying anymore dont know what to do nexti will never again buy a game from ubisoft i have been having issues with my ubisoft games lately and i was told by steam that i needed to reach out to ubisoft i sent them a request and they responded the next day since the first response i have reached out 4 times with no reply i would give 0 stars honestly i cant get any of their games to play and i have tried to do everything in my power to fix it myself its been 2 weeks and i still cant play any of their games that i havent already activated they ask for a key which i was told i dont need anymore but that hasnt stopped ubisoft connect from asking for a key lol its incredibly frustrating to be ignored for so long when i have tried to keep the communication lines open terrible company they dont understand a simple requestnever respond in a timely manner to raised tickets and constantly trying to close support tickets whilst literally doing nothingi have a few games from ubisoft but am determined to avoid this gaming publisher and this uplay platform as it reminds of games fir windows live and im expecting it to fail and cause major problems for its customers especially based on how there support is now how dare you not allow me to uninstall any of your applications without logging in to your launcher that is a disgusting practice not even used by malware ea instant uninstall rockstar instant uninstall battle net instant uninstall its a market practice not only that you also force an update to your launcher and dont have the development budget or ability to write code that can remember passwords on a pc disgusting never playing any of your lack of development games again rs6 has just collapsed a brand that had so much potential as a child some of my favourite memories are on tom clancy vages far cry i have tried 4 different email accounts and 2 different ps profiles just to play one game i even got the online chat and that did f all i wish i could give negative stars i will be demanding a refund f this company 5 hours almost a whole evening comical levels of awful they sell lies and steals money for games full hackersno support for ban they support hackersaimboot and other cheats are legal in this poor companyremove this trash from world what a useless game store bought heroes of might and magic vi and it is unbelievably buggy every time i try to start the game i have to enter password saves fail to synchronise constantly shocking service nothing like good old steam or epic store dont go ubisofti just have to warn people from buying anything from ubisoft bad reviews go years back and yet they havnt learned anythinghusband and i bought ghost recon breakpoint a week ago the game itself is a lot of funbut most of the time it takes forever before you are lucky to get in or it lags or crash earlier today i tried for 40 min log into the game but gave up at the end later we wanted to game a little before i had a raid in another game but i once again had no chance of gaming because the game keeps crashing we have tried nearly everything but i am about to give up and never going to buy another game from ubisoft i have had no problems with others games through steam whenever i try to log in to ubisoft connect on my pc i get the error service is unavailable try again later i have tried almost every fix reported online including everything on ubisofts site itself and nothing worked i contacted ubisoft support giving them a list of all the potential fixes i had tried already and attaching the msinfo and dxdiag files as requested about 15 week later i got a response with a link to a page with the most basic fixes all of which i had tried already and the message if this doesnt work please send us your msinfo and dxdiag files in other words they seem to have disregarded the majority of my message and just sent me a reply that could have been written by a bot ubisoft as an entire company is the most inadequate group of morons you will ever see they are literally a tech company that cant produce a working piece of tech to save their lives if the end of the world could be stopped if ubisoft just had to fix one single problem you better say goodbye i dont know how many second chances a company can get before people stop running back for the same garbage  dont even get me started on ubisoft connecthow many times can i spend money on one game only to be essentially locked out because they wont play nice with steam or something stupid just complete garbage and i hope

doubt the single worst team of moderators and managers out there issues happen often and it seems as though the staff whore supposed to help you in solving errors and answering questions have absolutely no idea what the hell theyre doing signed up for ubisoft was aloud to download a game went to play and they said i was suspended look at my account it says payment issue even though i got confirmation look at my bank was charged 3 separate times and only refunded 1 now i have a locked bank account and less than no money aka nsf fees ubisoft is an absolutely terrible game developing firm and siege is so ass the devs are incompitent i would use swear words but they arent allowed i just had the worst experience ever on trying to log into something i just installed uno earlier today and i wanted to play it but then i discovered that i need ubisoft to play it so i did that and when i created an account and everything i tried to log in to my account again on uno but for some stupid reason my password was incorrect even though i typed it in correctly i tried so many things to make sure i can get in but the password still said it was incorrect then i got suspended for trying so many attempts on logging in i fkin had enough so i uninstalled ubisoft and uno out of anger never using this website again trash and useless is way too sweet of a review the customer service is the worst they dont listen and they keep on repeating my mail out of nowhere didnt work and wasnt able to log in and kept on saying the mail doesnt exist in the system tried to reason with them too many times until i gave up and made a new acc on xbox and ubisoft needing to start all the way fxing over with my games how disappointing the boxed just dance 2023 for the nintendo switch was just a code in the box why bother shipping at all  deceptive and disappointing if you are not going to sell me the catridge dont sell it in a box horrible company  downloads are absurd  they download a little and then stop sending files for 20 minutes then they send a little more and stop again  this goes on constantly  this seems to be an indication of what i can expect trying to play their gamesno thanks useless programming useless games    sissy coward company  french  what a shock lol assassins creed mirage had to stay 1 hour for a fung book ridiculous they ask you to authenticate any random time  pain in the ass experience and i decided to jut take the loss of  and uninstall all of their software terrible frustrating experince worst experience ever i wrote a ticket 4 months ago and it took them 4 months to respond to me and what i got is it is outside of 14 days rule like yeah if you respond to me 4 months later i literally cant register the site is absolute garbage and after it allowed me to register it blocked me from logging it i am speachless how can it be so bad ubisoft is absolutely useless i cant even start their games on their own damn game launcher ubisoft has to be one of the worst things to exist they log you out of your account and make you buy the same game over and over even though you logged into the same email an utterly useless platform would be better if ubisoft just let steam do its thing autonomously about a year ago i used ubisoft to play apex legends with my primary acc days later i got perm ban it said that i disrespected the tos and i literally read the whole tos most people dont read tos but i do i make another acc so far im not banned i reached out to them with no help never go here ubisoft is absolutely sh1 it takes forever to load and never allows me to join or invite anyone i have this issue every single time i hop on to play it frustrates me and makes me get off i have yet to have a time where it works the first try it takes 25 minutes at the least to load me in dont rely on ubisoft ever pulling through on their end horrible company with lazy workers absolutely stinking company i brought a ubisoft plus subscription it wasnt working on my xbox contacted ubisoft several times they told me i need to upgrade my subscription to play on xbox telling me i brought a pc subscription instead but my bank says they charged me 1499 not 1299 for which is how much the pc subscription is ill now have to go through the bank when i offered them to give it to me in credit wankers horrible servers i couldnt even play one match this is stupid its been 9 hours fix your servers emails are not being sent my account has just been locked for suspicious activity and when i asked for support in discord their automated discord bot deleted my question for spam what a horrible service crazy how you can pay the price of a product and cant dictate if you retain that possession the worst system in the world impossible to download or open games i have had this problem with 68 games fro ubisoft dogwater absolute dog sht customer service and when you forget your password and try multiple your account gets suspended fix your sht ubisoft purchased something in error and tried to ask for my money back within hours refusing to refund me i have been a ubisoft customer for many years since the original rayman on the ps1 and then assassins creed on the xbox 360  i am a massive fan of the trials games and have bought them all over the years  however after dealing with ubisoft connect i will now go out of my way to avoid buying anything from ubisoft ever again  ubisoft connect is complete garbage and it makes playing ubisoft games orders of magnitude more difficult to deal with  from the app not connecting or crashing or wanting to always be online or asking for the password over and over and over to signing me out not more than 15 minutes since i last signed in and ticked remember me ive just had enough  curse you ubisoft and all of your greedyincompetent executives making the decisions at the top  alongside the microtransactions that are basically turning ubisoft into ea games the latest trials game and riders republic are both massive hot messes and clearly hasnt been planned properly or tested from a ui point of view and thats even if i can play them due to ubi connect garbage getting in the way  games dont need a launcher nowadays and ubisofts insistence to integrate everything more and more heavily in the terrible launchers has driven away a customer entirely  well done ubisoft you probably wasted a great deal of money and teams of people to create connect and all its done has ensured that a long time customer has grown to hate your organisation and i will be doing my absolute best to avoid playing anything you make in the future the fact that im so angry with your company that i have to write a review here simply makes me even more angry  i hope youre happy because i sure as hell am not and im going to vote with my wallet  by the looks of the other reviews on here i am not alone in my opinions  well done your corpoate leadership are cretins who are out of touch with their customers  sack them all and replace them with an old mouldy potato hooked up to a random decision generator  it wouldnt make things any worse the way i see it i got a matchmaking error before i loaded into a ranked i restarted my game and tried to load back in im on new gen xbox and the loading screen took that long that my team managed to ban maps ban operators get to choosing the operator and have 30 seconds for cancel time and i still didnt load in and got a 1 hour ban this is so bad there should not be a cancel option if ubisoft servers dont work half the time btw ubisoft use need to hire new people because use are just ruining the game update by update liars and thieves they have my 15 year old sons money and refuse to give him what he paid for cs is horrible sucks cant get in and play with friends cant join and when they try join me it failes all time games full of bugs difficult to play ruining the game experience extracting money with multiple dlcs without reason to exist cannibalizing on the assassins creed franchise double dogpoo sandwich avoid their games like fire i want to get my stolen acc back but they even wont let me write to them so bad i cant find the words bad bad bad shame on you terrible customer support cant even buy ingame content cuz payment errors imagine being that bad that cant even receive money from players ubisoft connect never f works end up restarting my pc multiple times i will not receive invites or send them game crashes randomly r6 has been out for like 7 years and cant even invite people half the time no matter how many times i create a password to login somehow some way i always get suspended ubisoft sucks hi so ive been playing ubisoft games for years ive always enjoyed them but never have a i seen such shark and scammer business practices and such terrible customer service from a legitimate company in a long time i bought a season pass for one of their games that didnt work with mine the ingame store would pop up with an error message whenever i tried to access the in game store everything was installed properly and it didnt work so i opened a support ticket i got one response being told to do what i already tried i responded and ive gotten no other response for a nearly a month and then they close my ticket because i havent responded but i have responded theyve just been ignoring my ticket i have no doubt theyre waiting until im not able to get a refund anymore their live chat hours run from 9 am to 11 am which is an insanely short time frame but not only that the live chat button disappears for any purchase related issue i understand that they may be busy however ignoring me and then closing my ticket took it a step too far for my tastes the games dlc still doesnt work properly for two separate consoles and theyve done nothing to help ubisoft connect is the absolute worst piece of garbage on this planet cant even play the game i purchased on steam because the ubisoft connect app cant recognize the ownership of the game i cant believe growing up i thought assassins creed was so cool when this is the type of company owning the title im done horrible just horrible i hate everything about ubisoft i just want to play siege but its broken and the weird part  is siege is working just fine its the overlay of ubisoft connect thats just aweful i hate it and want it gone or just fiz it please fix ubisoft connect but in the end i know it wont be cause french people are this way my account has been stolen by someone when i contact support team and show them the evidence of the transactions they told me we are sorry and we cant do nothing so just to be respectful with the company i had problems with this st since years now i bought a lot of games on this piece of crap and cannot log in with my registered account i mean you waste an hour of your life trying to log in cause if you dont stay online non stop they log you out and its the same fng waste of time every time i mean what the  what is with this dumb mentality to log everybody out or always ask for relog if i set that this pc is safe and should remember me they are the worst of all thats what they are and just want to thank them for getting all that money from people only for not being able to use that something you paid for game is fine but everything around it is awful bad cheat detection and whenever you try to submit a ticket to help get rid of cheaters the site doesnt work and the submit ticket button is unavailable in november 2022 ubisoft ran a special for 12 months for 100 with 3 extra months free i allowed my son to purchase it because it stated cancel anytime with refund he starts trying to use it and there are virtually no songs on there so we try to cancel it the website says he has no subscription but they deducted 109 from my bank account on 112822 i sent a message requesting a refund but have not heard anything back yet this website is a total scam greedy unhelpful unprofessional 20 minutes just for attempting again to log in just do not care for users time what are you afraid that i might lose nuclear rocket codes ffs tha worst gaming compani off them all  full off bugs hakers and you name it  they dont fix anything  they dont care about the buyers or there opinion  my point is close the company o better yet sell it to some competent people  your not competent to make even a drawing  if i could i would put a fuin 0 out of 5 its literal st i only play one game that uses ubisoft connect and i find it st this company cannot take the money and put it into a real fuin project i had to install the game on epic games and on fuing ubisoft connect because its that retded dont use it if you can ubisoft connect  customer support is trash would not use if i knew a way around f whoever made this you sucked up that paycheck and spit out garbage ubisoft literally breaks every single game it develops normally when new updates are to come out referring to r6s currently and they dont even bother to pick up the pieces afterwards absolute disgrace of a company to charge as much as they do for games when the developers cant even keep something as basic as multiplayer working tragically broken this failure of a launcher is blocking myself and so many others from games we paid good money for this should be criminal the login system is completely broken and has seemingly either not improved at all or actually gotten worse over the last year or so is ubisoft too busy counting their money to actually deliver a decent user experience the app makes me to retype my username password and an emailed code every single time i try to open a game it wont remember my username or even my computer i made a point to log out properly last time and it still said it timed out due to inactivity its incredibly irritating and is poisoning my love of the assassins creed franchise i cant search for friends in the game overlay because the hotkeys for switching between tabs are q and e and everytime i search for someone with one of those letters in their name the tab switches and deletes my search how bad can you program something so simple i have so much hate in mu body because of this crap uplay game engine wannabe i have never experienced something this bad in my life they give out false sales and have horrible horrible log in it makes no sense since the release of far cry 6 on oct 7th 2021 ive continually had issues with the game starting up continually getting the same error time amd time again reached out to ubisofts technical support and got the run around the same runaround that ive gotten on previous ubisoft games i swear its like their tech support knows nothing about software at all all they do is repeat the same thing that the person before them said to try its almost like they dont even read the conversation leading up to the ticket being forwarded to them thats basic tech support responsibilities is to look at the damn notes to know that your customer already tried what youre about to tell them to try pathetic tech support pathetic buggy games pathetic company not worth surviving in this world fuckubisoft been playing rainbow six for a couple years now im about level 300 throughout the years the game has just got worse and worse and so has the customer service ubisoft dont do anything about customer enquiries just give u an automated message and copy and paste it into an email i bough a game didnt like at first i tried to give it another go but i dont like itafter a week or so they refushed to refuse to return the money try to get a refund in ubisoft or paypal is a nightmare and they made it to exaust you and dont return the money i will never buy anything digital with them let me start by saying that normally if you are trying to purchase a game you already own you get a warning that you already own the game or a warning that this can only be a gift that makes sense right just like on steam you can purchase a game for yourself or gift or if you own the game already you are given a warning that you already own this game and it can therefore only be giftin 2020 i purchased a game on ubisoft as a gift for my brother keep in mind i already owned the game and had more than 500 hours play time in the game i didnt know that you cant gift games on ubisoftanyway of course ubisoft is a scamming company so they let you purchase as many copies of the same game you own as possible after purchasing the game i realised that i couldnt gift the game even though i now owned 2 copies i contacted ubisoft and they refused a refund because i already had 500 hours in the game even though id only purchased it 2 hours agoi had to contact paypal to get my money backubisoft then banned me from buying anything in the store but never actually told me about the ban when i had trouble buying anything else in their store they said it was maintenance and when i questioned them how it was possible that a friend could buy something but not me they just said that it was an error and try later fast forward 8 months and i was still banned and unable to buy anything in their storeon 1st october 2021 i prepurchased a game which was released at the end of january 2022 mid october 2021 i found the same game elsewhere but for 10 cheaper so i decided to cancel my preorder and get a refund to buy it elsewhere but ubisoft cant make it as simple as you just click to cancel a preorder no noyou have to create a ticket and contact customer serviceson 10th of october 2021 i created a ticket to cancel the preorder and to ask for a refund but by beginning of january 2022 id still had 0 response about cancelling my preorder i then had to contact paypal yet again to get my money back the game was released at the end of january 2022then on 10th of february 2022 i got a response to my ticket saying that id already got my refund through paypalno mention about being banned or getting bannedfast forward to end of october 2022i tried to make a purchase few days ago and purchase failed and i have received email that my account is flagged as fraudulenthere is what email saysa recent transaction associated with your account was flagged by our security system as being potentially fraudulent and as a result this transaction has blocked please note that you have not been charged for this transaction we will continue to monitor activity on your account as part of our ongoing efforts to protect accounts from fraud once again contacting ubisoftgiving me excuse there is maintenance and when i said my friend was able to make purchase and i got this they said it happens wait 48 hours and try againwhat a scam company this isrefuses to refund you but when you get money back through paypal they ban you for their mistake and then they treat you like shtalking down to you like you are 5 year old patronizing and absolutely giving 0 shs about youthe worst company out therei would rather talk to pc technician in call centre in india than dealing with ubisoft scammers its always a really poor experience when dealing with ubisoft ubisoft has caused me more pain and suffering than any other gaming related company bar nonetheir stupid mandatory pc launcher has constant issues their games have had massive backend software issues for about a decade now when you complain to support of the issues theyve left in their expensive products they outright refuse to even consider that there might be a problem with the product  while there are thousands of reports all over reddit of the same thingthese people are scum and you should never buy any ubisoft product even if the game works their launcher doesnt 90 of the time so you wont be able to play without piratingscum absolute scum bad company allow abusers and groomers to work for them and do nothing to reprimand them could not care less about anyone but themselves i have had massive difficulty with ubisoft relating to customer servicei tried to log onto ac valhalla to play after taling a yearlong breaki got notified that my account was compromisedthey sent me a password reset linkto an email address that was 20 years oldwhen i opened two separate customer service tickets because they dont have a phone number to call they told me they needed screenshots of me logged into the 20 year old email addressthat had been deleted by the service provider when i told them the email provider told me directly that the account had been deleted they would not ask me additional verification questions to verify my identitythis company has been an absolute headache and frustration to deal with dont buy games from them or give them any business they will rip you off a day of mail to not resolve any problem patched all my network drivers uselessly as obviously theres a bug in the login procedure the worst game platform the worst servers r6 is unplayuble now dont download any of their games their servers are dying took 6 emails of going back and forth verifying my account that was hackedsecurity is so bad that hackers get thru a lot compared to steam  epic games etc and also got 2 factor authenticator and still got thru get china money im dissapoint to ubisoft  3 or 5years will  be china company ubisoft  dont support ubisoft anymore the site is so fing miserable that you cannot redeem codes on the website you can only do it in the downloadable app version terrible experience never play from this stupid launcher and dont support this indie company i cant connect to ny old email account because it has been deletedit is still connected to ubisoft and my playstation therefore i cant change from my old ubisoft account to my new one on my playstation i have tried to make you to understand 57 times now but without luck ubisoft i hate your customer service from now on i will never again buy any of you games rot in hell nothing ever works 3 uac every stupid update very bad launcher if i could give them 0 stars i would i accidentally purchased a game that i was trying to buy an extended version of not repurchase the game i already had when i asked for a refund after weeks of slow responses back and forth they refused to give me a refund i never have issues like this with any company i wouldnt recommend this company to anyone ever uplay is the most useless thing on the face of this planet its super obvious ubusoft only cades about money why cant i play assassins creed brotherhood on steam without it downloading uplay updating uplay updating ubisoft game launcher updating assassins creed holy cow over the steam info that says ubisoft online services will no longer be supported obviously not i just downloaded the game on steam its been updated and verified let me play my game i literally uninstalled the game because of how pathetic this is i wont bother playing the game now especially with how many things ubisoft has to update and to go through this every single time would never recommend buying their products some absolute genius just asked me to log into my suspended account to check to see who or what has been trying to access my account and triggered an automatic suspension how to fix wait an hour maybe 24 maybe have to change devicescool nice fix ill just buy a new pc shall i you absolute talking fish ubisoft are the absolute worst at everything but their customer service team are somehow worse still you would think a company this bad would put extra effort into their customer service to try and turn things around but no they went the other way instead0 stars fire everybody start again call it noplay this time to reflect to state of the app  their front end launcher for pc is garbage they offer games on pc with versions on xbox steam gog  epic games but if you purchase your ubisoft games on different sites and not all in one place their launcher doesnt recogonize you own the games if your gonna force people to use your launcher at least teach it you sell your games on different sites constant errors of you need to download or cant locate even though the email is the same sowth actually awful support cant proceed with retrieving my stolen account because a screenshot that shows them what they need isnt correct honestly if your account was hacked just get a new one stupid support with 2 brain cells this game has the most toxic people in it there should be no team killing at all im tired of getting killed by my own team in ranked and quick match both the ranking system for people who sólo q is just no fun this was once a cool and fun game until the community grew with nothing but toxic ass kids such a bad platformuseless origin steam and even dear ol nintendo have better service and abilities over this piece of garbage i hate this service product their games never work theyre always glitchy and badly coded multiplayer games dont hold a connection and its overall a bad product giving it a one star is too much these people havent created a great game since far cry 3 but unfortunately that created ubisofts comfortability basis for half of their of games in terms of game design ubisoft has killed the tom clancy franchise looks at rainbow 6 siege i remember they denied us skins because they wanted to keep the game tactical and instead of getting a bunch of custom outfits or allowing modders to implement skins to the game because ubisoft customization team for everything sucks they give you a random chance at getting some bullsh1t outfit during an event but unless you throw your life money or both away you cant even get the full idiotic outfit tell me another developer that calls a game cross platform that doesnt have a party system enabled cough cough for honor ubisoft in the last decade has killed everything they touched they are just the french ea and the only reason they get away with their absolute mediocrity at best every year is because of how ea and bethesda keep doing stop buying ubisoft products they are just as predatory as ea just not as competent ubisoft is absolutely and utterly a garbage company cant get any worse and terrible than ubisoft who never listens to the community can not handle their damn servers and not to mention the amount of hackers that they let roam free on games if i could give negative stars for ubisoft they would surely deserve as many negative stars as possible imagine having your account banned 24 hours because hackers kick everyone out of a game and you have to face the leaver penalty essentially i am getting punished because a hacker kicked me out of a game before he used his aimbot to end the game trash gaming company absolutely trash and nothing more yall need to sell the company cause its currently run by a bunch of freaking bums and idios their support system chat or whatever it may be doesnt even get back to you when you report a problem sell the company if youre not going to look out for the people who buy and play your games you idios utter garbage ubisoft connect is literally unusable and will not load anything and because of that i am not able to play far cry 5 on my pc when i have game pass you should be ashamed of yourselves will not be purchasing any more ubisoft games including the sea of thieves knockoff skull and bones which i was actually going to try out millions of dollars a year and you guys cant even make a working app go kill yourself garbage company that doesnt care about their customers i just uninstaled every single game from them  bought the games on steam but still need their stupid unreliable platform that always reset  that why i dont play thoses games often  but i got familly here and want to play monopoly  cant connect cant reset password allways asking for password to reset a password seriously   i would never bought a game ever that got any link with ubisoft farcry 5been playing it for so long then out of nowhere deletes all my guns but 2 planes boats cars ect sends me back to like where the game begun but map still unlocked and bosses dead couldnt be more pissed off with the game definitely the last ubisoft game i will ever buy i have reset the game multiple times and even reset console still same problem got 2 available weapon slots rest are locked out  talk about waste of time and money buying this game was excited bout number 6 too not a hope in hell ill be buying it now they try to be so special but fail miseerbly i bought a digital version of assassins creed odyssey yesterday it keeps showing a message on my ps4 console that the data is corrupted and to delete and reinstall the game again over and over ive never seen that message on my ps4 before until now ive done that 4 times trying to play it and im done i wasted 9999 on the gold package of assassins creed odyssey they dont care about their customers and neither does sony concerning digital downloads you will never see that your money gets back to you if they are digital downloads so do not buy digital versions on playstation make sure you always get disks and dont buy any games that are digital from ubisoft either connect ubisoft worst app ever and customer service made a ticket for a issue received a mail saying my ticked has been cancelled because i havent answered but in the same email was the email i was supposed to respond so many bugs and issues you should stick to making games not apps because you are completely useless at that this is by far the most broken game launcher ive ever had the displeasure of having to use constantly goes offline crashes having to log back in after opting in to stay logged in cant ever synchronize my damn achievements an intern at another studio would be embarrassed if this was their work but its dysfunction is proudly displayed by the ubisoft team good job guys another reason to hate the company uplay is so far the worst gaming platform ive have ever contact with constant bugs ae failure to conect with the cloud  then have to click again  voila it works always asking for password  mein gott let alone the process of activating a product i do sincererly regret buing homm vi here ubisoft app is absolutely sad they cant update it to save their lives and cant release dlc on time extremely trash company i dont think any of their staff has any idea what is going on most of the time not just at work in their general lives tooi always get this mental image of some brain dead stupid idiot who decided to drop between 6 and 8 acid tabs before clocking in and just sits and stares at their screen whenever presented with a problemfrantically searching their script book they have for generic responses and posting whichever one looks suited to the topic at handits astonishing that these people get paid money to essentially do nothing even their programming team sucks which is apparent if you have ever tried to use the piece of crap bit of software they force people to reluctantly have on their pcs in order to play their money grabbing titles the software is horrific i was offered the chance to download far cry 4 for free as an amazon prime member this required creating a ubisoft account and linking it to my prime account after going through the required steps and installing ubisoft connect it was not clear how to download the game there is nothing so obvious as a my games menu option i searched the store for far cry 4 and was offered a download link it claimed it would take 90 minutes so i went on with my evening thinking to play the next day so when i woke up my desktop the next day i found the download process had stalled and never restarted after about 15 minutes i have already uninstalled the ubisoft client the whole experience reminds me why i gave up on computer gaming it is all about samesh app that lets you buy a subscription while being registered and stating that you are in a country that is not eligible that is not fair tricking your clients into paying for nothingsh support that is unable to see the cause of unavailable service and trying to put the guilt on the buyerincompetent and unprofessional assistance are you even checking the links you are sending terms are not available at the link you have providedi am sick of ubisoftwill repost this i have some free timethank you for nothing cant even log in to this 𝔰𝔥𝔦𝔱terrible dont buy any games on this and should boycott this crap company should have been a straightforward redemption of a free code for ac valhalla which didnt work then went into a doom loop with a very poor customer servicechat system that kept blaming my system setup  very ineffective and patronising so gave up after a day  been with them for over 7 years and purchased several expensive games but they really couldnt care less so will take my custom elsewhere and close the account worse experience force me to change my password for security issue after a while i forget the new password so i used the forget password linkand somehow there reset password email system doesnt seems to be working as i have tried many times to reset my password so i need to contact themthen i found outthere is no where to contact them unless you login to your account no way at all so if there is issue with your account you just cant contact them so i have to go somewhere to register a fake email to create a fake ubisoft account  just to get in touch with thempatheticridiculouswhen login again you found out their chat system not working asking you to create a ticket in which i did not get any responsehey ubisoft just shutdown ubiplay like bethesda and change to steam do all gamers a big favourpleasei still have some ubisoft games on hand physical cd maybe i should be selling them terrible service stayed up for 3 hours just for bots to talk to me and not get anywhere with my problem a bunch of worthless st stains r6 siege always fails with some random error after 12 matches and this happens to all of my friends in my squad they butcher existing maps and add fucing stupid operators ubisoft connect never remembers my trusted device or my credentials for that matter its 2022 id rather st in my palms and start clapping instead of giving money to these fng rd braindead twatwaffles hiive tried to purchase far cry 6 game i was unable to add funds to my wallet i was even unable to pay for the game using card or pal terrible i wonder how they make money ubisoft connect is terrible had to mess around with the internet settings to get into my account sort your it out steam always worksit gets worse i tried to play far cry 6 for the first time and the game requires an update the problem is it wont download and install the update as it gets stuck preallocating disk space even though there is more than enough space seriously this is the last time i bother with your terrible software your competitors are way better you should feel bad now go sit in a corner and think about the mistakes you have made fuk you fucing dogsit company fix your fucing servers complete trash company ffs tried resetting password twice and my account is still suspended due to wrong attempts nice ubisoft very nice sick of everything going full online  it takes forever to load and all most of us want is to immerse ourselves in killing  shooting game play we dont want to play online with others stupid irritating bs you guys are idjits for a adding a chsracter with a gun on for honor especially being to use it with every attack move the person or team creating him ahould be fired for no using their  brain avoid these ripoffconmen at all costs first i bought rainbow six extraction and was listed as buddy pass available after i buy it turns out it wasnt available but almost a week later then it came up now to make matters worse when you purchased this from their store you got credited 10 euros funnily my wallet is empty and no puchases have been made avoid this devlauncher at all costs and dont support their chetty cheap skatin game developers uplay accounts can be hacked by their own employees when mine got hacked i called them and they say they cant do anything about it someone has my account playing games on my account and uplay cant help me get it back what kind of service is this i have purchased two games over the years at steam which seems like it goes out of its way to hide from you the fact that you have to dl more controlware that were actually ubisoft controlware trojans  one was heroes of mm vi  after a 1 hour dl and double secret sign up process and being forced to allow corporate controlware onto my computer the game didnt work  thats twice now  to summarize total corporate control of you in your home and game doesnt work  i do so love the llc is the mesiah world we live in absolute terrible customer service you wait forever in the chat only for them to continually escalate it above to the next tech at what point you have to just wait for them to email you i have waited two weeks for them to supposedly transfer my service to my account the only account i have had since i started playing video games they are a pile of poop and i would rather watch horse porn then play a game of theirs the dumb brain dead losers aside from far cry 3 anything else can go eat a fat bowl of chodes ugly dickweeds most useless customer support ive ever dealt with could not cancel my ubisoft for 3 months sent multiple emails they have taken out over 80 when i only wanted 1 month  i cancelled auto renew the first month and it didnt process clearly never gives these oxygen thieves your money this program is so terrible that im tilted about not being able to give it zero starshonestly worst freakin experience its such a nightmare to use that i honestly stopped playing the games i bought on it which i actually in total put quite some money down for i dont even care i freakin hate using ubisoftconnect and everything else ubisoftbut connect is the worst every single freakin time i have to login again and every time i check the box to stop logging me out and every time i go through the whole drag of logging in it tells me i need a new password and every time i make a new password and close my mail i forget i also need to enter a verification code that i also got via mail and its such a freakin hassle that i quit i freakin quit all the games i have on thereto the people that design ubisoft i hold nothing against you personally but find a new freakin job because you made playing games a bother and a drag good freakin job so bad keeps logging me out for no reason rainbow 6 is so bugged sometimes it says im playing but nothing is opened ubisoft needs to fix their crap all ubisoft games crash frequently to the point of unplayable this will be due to there poor quality drm good quality drm is found in steam not ubisoft i would recommend avoiding all ubisoft games as a total waste of money this company is terrible  nothing works correctly  their ubisoft console only works about 75 of the time  save files dont sync between my desktop and laptop which makes playing on both nearly useless  support is even more useless it takes them about a week to respond  they recently broke anno 1800 over a holiday christmas and new years to where you cant build things that used to work and instead of rolling back the update which was useless except a stupid little santa flying around they announce that the problem wont be fixed for about a month  wth ubisoft  what other company does this  breaks one of your biggest titles when people are off work for literally no useful reason and then not just roll back the update  seriously ubisoft may be the gayest company out there for video games since gay pride became popular they now have 3 gay operators which pisses me off on a personal level ps do not buy flores his ult is sucking dick i cant even log in it disconnects me all the time and i have to reinstall it always it sucks this uplay or ubiconnect thing just keeps crashing nothing works you cant play games you own and now i even cant buy new games cos their ubistore bugs out and i cant simply pay why is ubisoft so extremly bad worst game producer ever  they just make empty promises like our government and never put in life whatever they say game gonna look like far cry 6 is terrible biggest world but bugged and boring 20 years ago games had much better plot and side quest than this repetetive piece of  my account was hacked and someone spent 500 on my account i notified the website about the hack and fraud charges was told sorry they pretty much didnt care that the order was complete to someone elses xbox that they wasnt going to refund and wouldnt look into it i have over the last 5 days have wasted in excess of 10 hours trying to get a game to load up i have sent countless files to there support team and i get the same suggestions every time there trick is once they dont know what to do they tell you to do something that requires the computer to restart then you have to talk to a different support member who will take 5 minuets to read the notes and advise you the same stuff that you had already tried its a vicious cercle the end result is you pay for a game you cant playin short this company specialises in day light robbery how hasbro allows ubisoft to destroy their reputation with the trash games they release is unfathomable particularly with their xbox release of monopoly plusive known ubisoft since they released fairly decent bug games for the bbc micro but what has happened to the quality control in recent timesnowadays if i see ubisoft on a game i simply avoid purchasing knowing that itll crash have problems logging in or just have bugs in the coding they had a sale on  so i got the game in there shop  i got a receipt and email from ubi and paypal confirming my order  after an hour it didnt show up in my games list  i was told to wait 24 hours  i did then was told to send over my proof  i did 2 days later they asked me to send over proof of purchase  then 4 days later again  then 6 days  each time asking me for what was attached in the 1st contact  showing each time they replied on the bottom of the page  included  so each time i readded the same proof  and every reply was just asking for the same information  i then contacted paypal and sent them the same proof of purchase  and they gave me a full refund in less than 5 minutes i chased ubisoft for an update on what was going on and they just asked me for the same information again  then i said paypal refunded me  and their reply was  oh so your issue has been resolved then  and closed the ticket just the worst company literally a bad company went from doing good games to being hated like mad for a good reason ubisoft connect will steal from you took over 200 dollars from me because it is so broken on top of that it wont let me buy anything with it nor refund me and i get fraud warning emails from them how is this legal there is zero customer serviceupdate ubisoft finally rectified the problem not changing the rating as it took a week and the only way to contact them is through a hard to use and navigate forum system this is common for reporting game bugs but for money issues no banks would never use a system like this this cavalier system ubisoft uses to fix bugs that happen with real money on users accounts does not inspire consumer confidence or mine oh and this issue i had is a system fault and common this is the first and the last time i spend any money with ubisoft there are many other good games out there from other companies currently it wont let you play singleplayer games without and an internet connection 60 and when the servers are down as they currently are you cant play something like far cry 5 which is 90 single player with an optional coop  amazing  never buying a game through uconnect or whatever they rebrand it as in the next few years if there was a 0 star i would have chosen that from the start when they wouldnt let me launch rs6 to now buying a brand new game far cry 6 not even from their store they had something to do with it linking games the usual unnecessary crap like why r u trying so hard to cause pain to people we dont want you and when i went for customer support they said oh sorry bro its epic games fault not ours where it was clearly their fault and i told them it was they changed something and then of course nothing happened ubisoft connect gave my computer some sick form a capitalistic cancer ill be working on homework and get a random advertisement for a game even though ive tried turning that feature off i dont want advertisements on my personal computer thats why its personal i tried to buying their games through other platforms but i always have to download this trash app anyways an app that struggles to work at first ubisoft cares about nothing more than making money which is humorous given that they have become so separated from their player base they havent a clue of what makes them happy versus downright furious took over a hundred dollars worth of points from my account after they falsely claimed that they could be used towards anything which they cant i highly recommend people use steam or origin instead ubisoft and everything related to them are dying out quickly bad games bad support bad company altogether i pity those that have to work for such a terrible business launcher so bad i can barely download the games i paid for on steam and epic i can just download games on ubisoft i have to stare the whole 55gb because ubisoft stops downloading every 10 minutes needs to restart and then repeat and repeat ubisoftdick connect is a clusterfuk crashes my game and now fails to sync with the game achievements and thus not allowing me to play the game fuk off retads absolute thieves and incompetent dimwitts incapable of helping even with minor issues no quality whatsoever in customer care lack of any sort of empathy blatant disregard for customer being upset creating and selling and stealing money on the worst games ever i hereby call everyone who reads this to boycott ubisoft and never ever but their product again if you do trust me you will regret it sooooo bad uplay does dos not launch so cant play their games spent a few frustrating hours and decided to just give up well the r6 servers kick me out of my ranked game then give me a ranked ban cause i couldnt reconnect and froze my whole game after that just pathetic that they give you the ban for the servers playing up do not join or buy anything on their official platform websiteapp i did it for youfirst i would like to point out that i am a huge huge ubisoft fan bought all their games and review is related only to their official platform uplaycomi purchased collections of games and never received them i tried opening customer support tickets for help and they turned me around telling me i have to speak with my bank for refunds as they are pending transactionsbecause i am stupid i gave it another try with different card after few games bought again my card was rejected and more pending transactionsi lost so much money for games on their platform i regret joining it i regret supporting them i am left with an awful and disgusting experiencetheir website should be an easy going buyplay experience but is not instead is a pain to manage to buy with cards being rejected for reason such as fraud my bank is dealing with that i do not need extra layers of worrying security making my life a nightmaredo not do it do not buy or even join their platform take it from me i wasted lots of money on them and it was pointless do not go there i did it for you ubisoft is the worst company of all time dont buy any of their games or you will regret it everythings is just literal asssssssssssssssssss nothing good about it purchased dlc for assassinations creed here is a quote from the email you would need to own both the game and dlc from the same digital store in your case you can either repurchase the game from ubisoft or repurchase the season pass on steamupdate dispute the charge on paypal and received a full refund  still disappointed in uplay for not offering to refund the purchase i told them i would never buy another game from uplay and their response was thanks for the update i recommend avoiding companies like this ubisoft has a terrible website ive been continuously trying to give them my money to try and buy ghost recon breakpoint and every time i try it says oops looks like you should try again later like ubisoft fix your stupid ass website also their customer service is worse than fortnite and thats saying something if you want buggy poorly made games where buttons dont correspond to movements and nothing works right then ubisoft is your company their blatant greed has led to the demise of 3 of the greatest game franchises in the world all because they dont want to take care of their games or customers their newest dlc on acv is the stupidest most poorly made least entertaining questline ive ever played at least 9 mega buggy super long super tedious challenges in which you have to kill 20 guys in extremely specific ways half of the time these ways are impossible or bugged to be impossible ie the wolf challenge on the third set of these challenges makes you kill 15 guys or so plus 4 bosses while hitting each of their weak spots which are usually either the knee or elbow but you hit that mark perfectly from point blank and somehow it doesnt register after that you have to finish each opponent off with a headshot kill but again you hit the head and it doesnt register so you sit there for hours trying to figure out what to do since the game doesnt work on top of that i bought the season pass and never got one of the dlcs the customer service team played me around and didnt respond to my requests until a day after i would be able to get a refund to ensure i didnt get my money back scumbags and criminals buy other games you wont regret it assassins creed rainbow 6 and far cry all ruined by incompetent money grubbing trash people uplay doesnt allow offline play wich means you can not play the games you bouhgt app doens remember login info i always have to do password reset even though i always use te same password this app is crap and should be avoided at all costs fking horrific i have never had so many fking issues with anything nothing works i bought two assassins creed games today one refuses to launch and ive spent hours attempting to fix it hundreds of people online in the same boat the second one asks me for a fking activation key even though i just bought it no fixes available update found the activation key for the second one now the game just craahes on opening  ubisoft is just getting in my nerves at this point everything on their website is so messy and complicated its hard to find what im looking for because there are things popping up such as new games coming out etc they have everything scattered everywhere on their account and the way they handle things is awful their service is absurd they take forever to do things and theyre only worried about money being relevant at this point siege is dying at a decently fast pace because they decide to add new things or they just dont want to fix the bugs inside the game on their website i was switching an email from my old account to another but after logging into one account  they wont let you log into another account if wanting to sign in through xbox whats the point of the forgot your email support tab if i cant even log in to be honest they dont even deserve a 1 star ubisoft games are absolutely crap they even sell their games for 3 at times because they know theyre doing a horrible job at game makingjust joined a for honor match midway in progress spawn killingcamping using cheats and software help for example if you have icue you can assign 34 buttons combo top just a single key making it easier to attack and assigning a key to click 20 times a second so that you get the exact timing block i left the match obvs and got a 15 min matchmaking penalty and not allowed to play online for honor for 15 minutes people will mass report you and get you banned they tell their friends as well which you just have to hope youll be fine or play badly and not kill anyone cos they will ragerainbow six same crap as well you get the ideaplease dont support ubisoft and their games as good as they might be theyre badly executed ubisoft is hot garbage they only listen to their pro players and ignore the community as a whole siege started out as a phenomenal game and slowly dwindled into the pile of crap that it is today the game mechanics are still broken jumping out a second or third story window doesnt even injure people cmon realistic my ass lets not talk about how many shots it takes to do anything in all of your games do you even know how guns work i bought the rainbow 6 collection i truly i bought it especially for vegas 2 but i cannot play multiplayer with it they dont drop a note to warn the people before the purchase after i failed the connect i checked internet and i realized that they shut down the servers already so i paid for nothing and now i cannot refund they gave just one day for refund in one day how can i try 6 games in the collection is it a jokethis is simply cheating people i dont recommend anyone to buy any product from ubisoftdont they feel shame after read all this negative comments their face is not getting red are they really happy to run this scam company dont pay for their crap they dont care about you at all quite literally one of the worst game launchers i have ever used prepurchased assassins creed here and had nothing but issues on launch now months later i tried to update the game to carry on after burning out i kid you not i have just spent a solid 5 hours trying to fix an issue with the launcher after going through multiple forums i found a solution on reddit from a random user i will never ever buy a game on this platform again ubisoft connect is a badly written piece of code created by a company that clearly does not care about its customers for further proof of this just look at ubisofts public statements over the last few years everything is the fault of playerscustomers nothing is the fault of ubisoft and their money grubbing policiesi used to be a big ubisoft fan back before always on drm was introduced i then stopped buying anything by ubisoft and have recently started looking at some of their stuff again every ubisoft game i have bought in the last year has been bought through either steam or epic store and in every single case after installing through the service i bought it on ubisoft connect has failed to properly authenticate the game and insisted on reinstalling the entire game through ubisoft connect i could understand installing an update or a ubisoft launcher but the entire game is just bad programming this is not the performance of a competently programmed application ubisoft connect is only saved from being the worst download service in existence by the abomination that is the microsoft store very greedy company blames gamers at every turn they get no wonder 33 of games get pirated easily and effectively by groups in a response of protest over these corporate liars and monopoly driven people in fancy suitsif more information is required please let me know i have tons more and aswell as threads speaking unlimited amounts of similar cases and this in specific ubisoft launcher is total gabage it shows errors never buy games on ubisoft i payed them 30 euro for rainbow deluxe edition and i cant even launch game because of ubisoft errors just pay steam and play games on steam unfortunately you have to give at least one star to write a review because it deserves no stars at all i had been playing ubisofts the settlers online for 10 years since it came out they switched to unity and my account just mysteriously disappeared i have sent a dozen support request tickets and never got a response period from any of them i had close to a thousands dollars invested in the game over a decade and they are simply not responding to me and there is no phone number to reach anyone directly now ubisoft is a horrible company that has no interest in its customers or responding to their requests i am taking legal action against them because this behavior is unacceptable and just plain bad business in whole do not buy anything from this company ever trust me im only filing a suit against them because they need to be held accountable for how they steal peoples money like they did me i just reached out to ubisofts live chat today for the last time and they flat out told me they couldnt help me and then pawned me off to the games support contact which has not responded to my requests for over 4 months imagine that absolute joke as with all their games fail to expand on their old ideas instead they just add more of the same and expect you to just deal with it and pay them money they have no idea that the reason ac valhall sold so well is not the rpg features but setting and the thought of playing as a viking went downhill after unity which in my opinion is the best ac game from a gameplay perspective no idea why they ruined a brilliant franchise by switching to a witcher type ripoff they should either reboot the franchise focused more on how the originals were like creating an engaging story with a  charismatic protagonist or carry on making these trash rpgs but at least take the assassins creed out of the name an assassin should be stealthy and intelligent so they can murder the target without getting caught not just charge in and kill everyone who gets in the way then leave with hardly any consequences ubisoft need to step up to the plate or risk losing their fanbase very annoyed at the mouth breathers who keep paying money of the helix stores just to get gear that should really have been in the game to start with absolutely ridiculous hope whoever the shot caller is at ubisoft goes bankrupt and their life crumbles in front of them greed shall be your downfall ubisoft connect is the only way to play the offline game i just bought ubisoft connect is down i hate you guys dont even bother playing valhalla youll be wasting your own time on poorly thought out side games and repetitive quests this game is rubbish when it could be good firstly stop saving to the internet it doesnt work it slows down the game to the extent that i spend half my time waiting for it to save i got to level 300 and then i had to start again because ubisoft servers messed up the game crashes every time i play its a bug heaven it also displays annoying messages right in the middle of the screen all the time another big problem is the way the character latches on to things when passing them the control programming is rubbish it auto aims when i dont want it to just to make the game that little bit more rubbish also get rid of the stupid animations i bought a computer game not a cartoon i contacted ubisoft and they blamed playstation the only problem with that is all my other games work without these problems i just wasted 120 on rubbish never buy an ubisoft productunless you actually like burning money i was given a new game on steam to launch in uplay but it kept coming up with an error instead of solving the problem the support staff went in circles bringing up imaginary second accounts and interrupting me at every given moment i demand recompense for my friend who lost a chunk of money buying me a game that i cant play because of the support teams lack of ability to do a simple taskeditupdate if i could drop it to nothing i would i have had to completely delete my ubisoft account and will need to make a new one which has caused me to lose progress on the games i could actually play all because of a stupid problem that ubisoft seemed incapable of solving congratulations i have lost all faith in you my once favourite game company you have fallen even further than i thought worst customer service took them a month to process a simple refund i had to initiate a charge back at my bank because i was sick of their nonsense responses avoid them guys if you make me install uplay when downloading games from epic again i might go berserk w tf is wrong with you every ac after the 4th is garbage there are no assassins its not even a good story and the fights look disgusting assassins should kill in a cool and efficient way and in far cry primal my hole progress is gone just like that i played this damn game 25h and all my damn progress is lost because i closed the game while dying and one min later when i started again i have to damn start a new game what the hell ubisoft  go die  i was told to write about the issue on their forumsthe only advice or support i recieved was to write about my issue on their forums appalling customer servicei am hugely disappointed in ubisoft right up to this moment i held this company really highly i cant believe this is how they treat their customers i should have come on here and see the rating to understandi had purchased 2 20 codes admittadly a long time ago using the 100 u points system from uplay via my ps4 thinking there would be games and add ons i could quickly purchase for my ps4 to my major dissappointment after purchasing these two codes i realised the majority of the games on the ubisoft store are for pc only as well as being a lot more expensive compared to other stores and therefore i could not purchase the games i wanted since then i have frequently visited the ubisoft store to try and find games or add ons for the ps4 and today i had finally found two games i wanted to purchase but now i realise that neither of my codes are any longer valid i look up why this might be and see this new system in place that tells me codes expire after 3 months this is news to methis news has been very disappointing to receieve had the ubisoft store had the content i orinially wanted on the ps4 i would have used both codes by now and in quick succession to be honest i feel very hard done by and wanted to complain i have now wasted 200 u points for nothing i should not be able to purchase the 20 store discount from my ps4 if the majority of games on offer in the store are not on the ps4 i asked ubisoft to advise and they sent me to the forumsno reinstating of the codes or no refund on the 200 u points i mean i want to purchase games from them now they are getting nothing such weird protocol not even worth writing a review on these play a game loose mmr due to disconnecting because of poor sever and then get banned for it absolutely shocking cant log into your account start a live chat with them and wait for ages to get disconnected laughing stock the the gaming world thats why they have no success with any games very bad they never work on there server platforms  cant play with friends due to bad nat type but i can play with them on other games but for honor been emailing ubisoft for probably a couple of weeks now about an issue and they still have not resoved it they keep asking for the same pictures i have already sent there is no help to be getting here terrible service ac valhalla store wont work game has a lot of bugs ans lags the ubisoft website is sloooow costomer service is useless horrible security measures waste my time for no reason they dont have a way to fix anything you just have to wait 75 minutes what is that the dumbest thing ive ever heard ever yall suck this company is absolutly pathetic relating to customer service buyer beware if you insist on purchasing games through ubisoft do not use their online services as they take your money and you have to spend weeks fighting their support team to get the game provided to you their support team reminds me of a media unit that takes no accountability and just denies everything claiming they dont have your money it took weeks and copious screenshots to get them to provide my softwaremy advice is use another provider or if you insist on using them be ready for massive issues and take screenshots and keep records or you will get ripped offcustomer services is non existent for this company oh gosh where to begin  awful customer service  hard to get in touch with them   i upload documents then they reply back asking me for the same documents whenever i buy a game from ubisoft it wont launch this happens on every game ive bought since 2014for 7 years theyve done nothing but screw me out of my hardearned money why do i keep coming back when they just dont care i am honestly blown away on how awful this company is i bought rainbow six siege for 20 dollars and then spent 10 dollars on the season pass then i played the game for 140 hours and out of no where they permanently ban me for cheating i have no clue why because i do not cheat i went to appeal the ban and they denied it i asked to see the evidence they denied it i asked for them to review the evidence again they denied it i am absolutely done with ubisoft and im so angry that i spent so much time playing with a horrid company ubisoft are the worst recently i purchase the game assassin creed valhalla for pc payment was not go thru but money was taken from my account create ticket for refund but still i didnt receive my money back they only rip off the people stay away probably i will delete my ubisoft account ubisoft with pushing this platform will have worse opinion then ea hopefully when they will feel lighter wallet soon they will wake up now they dancing in the fog dont buy any game from them theres only problems atm i paid for assassins creed black flag a while ago i tried to play it this week and it says the code is already activated with another account i have two accounts with them and both are active neither one has been deleted customer service was useless they just kept telling me it was on a deleted account and there was nothing they can do i dont know whats happened but basically ive bought a game i cant play and they wont do a thing about it they just told me to buy the game again of course they would say that which i cant because its already in my steam library and why should i pay twice i cant play the games i paid for on steam because of there beyond crap login system i really despise this company and really make playing my games way harder than it needs to be fix the login system on your games so your customers can get what they paid for absolutely horrible supportthese guys have no idea what they are doing over the course of two months and over 20 support people none of them know how to read an email or explain what is missing when i update my support all they do is repeat themselves over and over it took this long to find out they were looking at the wrong account because they wouldnt tell me the receipt was for the wrong account they just kept saying they needed a receipt for purchase i sent them 5 copies of the same receipt and no one told me they were looking for something elsewhile all this was going on ive had two other ubisoft games break because of known bugs after looking through forums and finding out these issues have been known about for months with no fix put out im more than frustrated and can say i doubt ill ever get anything from these guys again how can you have a game client on pc and the fact that if you buy a game it doesnt instantly go to your library for hours or days how can you call yourself a company this is some bs you guys should be ashamed tbh shocking customer service from ubisoft   if you happen to get your password wrong a few times you are punished with a 24 hours block from your account which apparently cant even be unblocked by customer serviceany other company manage to take you through security and then unblock your account so i cant see why ubisoft should be any differentlive chat agent wouldnt raise a complaint either wasnt interestedwhat a poor service 13 a month for the ubisoftplus service and cant even resolve basic queries fairly the ban appeals in games are a joke they are heartless and dont care about their customers i also bought a game from them with the servers not even working to play on which the point of purchasing was to play the multiplayer complete garbage ubisoft needs to work on their customer service tried downloading just dance unlimited on 2021 just dance they take money from my account for it but then make my account inactive which means i cant even use it i will be calling my bank to get my money back dont advertise something if you cant even use it tried callin g them and they just send you to their website you cant even message them on their website to help you fix the problem i suggest finding another dance game for your nintendo switch because this comany sucks customer service is the worst and theyre releasing games early even though theyre obviously not all worked out their multitude of websites and stores seem designed to mislead and scam you no more paying for ubisoft games from my part wouldnt even give it 1 star absolutely fkn dogger every time i try playin the crew it says services unavailable check ur connection even tho my connection is spot on just been playin war zone with no lag at all useless cnts i bought far cry3 and i didnt like the game at all i wanted a refund but they said that if you launch the game you cant refund it forever totally shiiiit company awful online store and desktop app i tried to buy anno 1800 today because it was 70 off but when i went to checkout the button to buy was greyed out it wouldnt even let me enter my card info from looking online its not the first time this has happened utterly useless do not recommend to anyone possible worst customer support ever im using their services buying games for 8 years and then they threat me with all that copypaste scenario stuff i just deleted all my info disconnected all payments method etc do not even stay close to this company this is by far the worst customer service ive ever had no one to physically talk to cant even play the new ac game waste of 60  i will never buy another ubisoft game in my life after the recent update to assassins creed valhalla the game has been unplayable due to crashes after only a few minutes of gameplay  i cancelled my ubisoft account since i was no longer able to play the game  now they are charging me for an entire month of service that i cant use and refuses to issue a refund  i opened a dispute with my credit card company there customer service is useless and careless unable to fix simple problemmy account was erroneously suspended and the agent told me that there was nothing that they could do to help i was told that i have to wait 24 hours and try again it seems a very simple problem and i am extremely disappointed that a huge company such as ubisoft is unable to fix something so simple horrible developer full price for games that consistently crash with no fix in sight they try and blame the issue on the console when the issue only happens with their games sorry but rdr2 is a much bigger and better game the ac valhalla and has less then half the percentage of problems ubisoft games do i will never purchase another ubisoft game again terrible horrible customer service recent game purchases have turned out to be trash if the game purchase was half price i could understand but this is an underdeveloped game with a terrible storyive been in contact for 1 month to no avail this is the first of many 1 start reviews until i get a refund i have purchased games from ubisoft since the 90s  suddenly games that i have purchased from steam all come up with cd keys not matching and login errors  i cant play games i paid for because they are using an email that i no longer have and when you try to update they send the information to the emailthat i no longer have  i just purchased a game from ubiconnect  they say they have no record of the purchase even though i sent them the paypal receipt with their account number on it  i am now seeing that this is standard practice for this company  this is a horrible company with terrible customer support and i would advise anyone to never purchase anything from them this is the 3rd time that my ubisoft account has been logged into from some other country i have had 2fa activated since the first time and i know that no one has access to those codes because the google authenticator app is locked to my device that means those codes can only be generated on my phone so their security is so poor that people can bypass their 2fa and get straight into your account i hardly even use the account and only ever type its information directly into the ubisoft login meaning it is strictly on their security absolutely unacceptable  closing my account right now so if i want to buy assassins creed valhalla and i live in puerto rico then i cant buy it from the ubisoft store this is because theres a problem where aparently puerto rico is located in brazil really bad joke and the sale wont come throughi would have to buy the game from epic games store but they are selling it at normal prices while in the ubisoft store the game has the ultimate edition at 20 off to give an examplei believe if you cant fix your own store you should at least have the same prices on the other platformor just stop the drama and let us have the game through steam paid for watchdog legion 3 weeks ago direct using paypal the game is still not in my library they have taken the money not supplied the game and are not responding to the case i think i will leave ubisoft games alone for the moment until they get their act sorted out its very poor ubisoft is the biggest scam in the world they took 3 times the money they should for the monthly subscription and now i have to contact my bank to get it back becouse those thiefs say that they cant do anything and dont have my money and i dont belive a single word from them slow server worst customer support slow response activation code wont even send bcs their server is slower than a snail whatever you do never write to them for support about a technical issue you will get one answer from them which will be of absolutely no help and then never hear from them again no matter how many times you write to them you will simply be ignored i have lost all faith this company can provide a well made product all of their online service games are buggy and servers are horrible the content is boring and recycled i cant even play your hasbro games without going offline or their servers will crash my system no refunds will ever be available ubisoft is a company full of incompetence and greed with no integrity left buggy games no fixes no communication terrible customer service complete mystery this company is not bankrupt yet i asked for help with billing and such stating i could pay them the money a week later and they still wouldnt help me  i have been a member for awhile dont give them your time they only care about your money terrible customer service and does not support military service membersbeing stationed overseas i am forced into using a foreign ubisoft connect and while trying to make a purchase on the store for helix credits so i can purchase contents for my valhalla game i am sent to a authentication page for my card which i then wait patiently no chargeso i contact customer service with this and instantly get accused of being suspicious and not to be using vpns or other programs and to turn them offi then go on to explain being a service member and my billing is stateside while im stationed overseas and the only response was sorry then you cant use our service for security reasons if i can validate the card if u sent the charges how would that be suspicious just because i am stationed outside of my billing addressterrible customer service and terrible platform for payments ubisoft uplay is garbage i purchased a ubsoft game through steam which required a uplay account i played the game three times before the errors started popping up claiming they cant authenticate ownership of the game locking me out of my account its been almost two months and the problem still not solved buyer beware stay away from any ubisoft game requesting that you open a uplay account you will not have total control of your account information i hate uplay  it is usless  why does every stupid private company think that james bond is going to try to break into their website so i am saddled with so many passwords 850000000 factor authentication  for fs sake  i bought a game and i cant even play it bc of f all ubisoft  fed up trackmania isnt a subscription model because you have to manually pay for the month just shut up you dumb ass took my money gave me an error looked into customer support which was dealing with customers so much that they shut the live chat the only thing they now use for customer service i have no way of doing anything to ask wth happened ubisoft login system is bad i forgot my password and tried to login few times and yea i got blocked from my accaount 1h so bad system they should put are u a robot instead of ban someone needs to investigate this crooked company their uplay subscription is one of the biggest cons i have known in history their customer service must be run by 12 year old gamers with serious attitude problems 1299 subscription taken twice one to check you are genuine and one for the over priced subscription the first payment takes up to 28 days depending on your bank if you have any issues with games purchases or anything dont expect any help from these people its time that these crooked companies were investigated support team sucks  servers are always downubisofts support team doesnt help they dont ever look into your case with depth always just links a faq link that 100 doesnt resolve your issuetheir servers are also almost always down dont need any explanation to thatpeople have also complained about their refund policy so many bugs and stupid servers worst organisation want to install watch dogs legion click here i clickand then it comes up with a want to install far cry primal terrible launcher no effort was put into the launcher at all customer service is also utterly awful uplay plus doesnt work launch game nothingsuper fun guys thanks i preordered assassins creed valhalla but asked to switch from the ps4 to the recently announced xbox digital version over a month before release and this is where ubisofts customer support and processes are the most useless that i have ever encountered in a game store they werent able to switch version despite both copies being in stock and since the credit card i used to purchase the game is closed its been waiting for two weeks so far for them to give me a refund voucher code today ubisoft told me they cannot guarantee that they can issue a simple voucher code or switch version before the same releases in another 3 weeks and they cant hold a copy for me in case it sells out meaning ill be left with a voucher code without a game to purchase what should be a simple switch is layered in ubisofts incompetent practices so dont order here unless youre willing to take the risk that if you have issues with your order youll be run in circles with no action and waste your time hearing lies ill only recommend this store to my enemies and tell everyone else to stay the f away worst server cant even log in i finally caved in and decided to prepurchase assassins creed valhalla i opened uplay added the game to my basket proceeded to check out and used 100 uplay points for the 20 discount all good so far i receive an error that my payment method is not valid for some reason  works on steam epic store battlenet origin and everywhere basically so i decided to buy it via the website i log in add the game and wanted to get the 20 discount again but i had no more points i contacted support got a reply after 9 hours that they cannot refund the points but that the code is valid and i should click on apply ok the code is valid but only via the uplay launcher where i keep getting the stupid error on the website store i cannot use the same code because who knew they had two separate stores the issue is ill gladly buy the game through steam but previously they have been known to release the game for people who bought it via uplay about 612 hours earlier than the users from steam which is an incredibly annoying practice uplay is simply awful over years of use i have found it never works properly across multiple computers and platforms i have had nothing but issues that run the full gamut it is always a minimum of 1520 minutes from uplay starting until the game finally launches if it does at all it is constantly waiting for updates stuck at logging in says its offline when i am clearly online or one of dozens of other issues many others i know have the same experience with uplaythere is also no consistency with the issues so i never know what to expect one time to the next bluntly i will never be purchasing another ubisoft product until uplay is scrapped crappy platform broke 2 of my games with steam compatibility issues games were purchased on steam too so the uplay service shouldnt be needed ubisofts advertising platform is just as bad as their competitors ive always had problems with ubisoft starting with r6 servers on xbox i thought moving to pc might help but it only got worse the 2 step verification is by far the worst thing ubisoft has done since ive been on the platform i stopped playing r6 due to the constant and repetitive nature of it and i decided to get back on but they change the 2 step verification from email to google authenticator which i never got a qr code back when i first signed up for it i am now suspended for failed attempts and my alt account that has no relation to my main is also suspended for too many attempts ubisoft has been a nonstop headache for me in the 5ish years ive used their services bought online game through steam from ubisoft had to create a account to play next day had to reenter account info but put in wrong emailcant play game ever again now locked access no customer service steam refunded money never going to buy another crap ubisoft game ever the worst store and game launcher ever2 years ago i bought homm5 with all dlcs but one dlc could not be installed because they uploaded a wrong release on their server i submitted a support ticket they just closed the ticket with a promise to fix it soon guess what its still brokennow i wanted to buy season pass 12 for anno 1800 i spent my club points to get a discount when try to buy it an error message pops saying my payment methodpaypal suddenly doesnt work i tried to submit a support ticket but doesnt let me throwing another error message what the fnever touch this pile of crap i bought my son a game because he earned it i later find out after i download the game that i need to make a ubisoft account for him to play long story short it was one of the most convoluted things ive ever had to do even though i was a parent signing up my child i still had to lie about his birthday just to get it to work now that its working theres even more issues ubisoft is a trash company and have the worst user experience and customer service bought a game on the ubisoft store for oculusthe key was to be emailed through shortly after the initial purchase  the key never arrivedas i wanted to play the game with my friends i bought it direct from oculus and raised a refund ticket with ubisoft in the end despite not playing the game they refused to offer a refund despite explaining i had only played the oculus version  avoid worst ever  worse than ea cant get into account with my password i use for past year every day  cant reset password  sent 40 reset password requests got 0 mails i wont pay them 1 more  i prefer to throw down the toilet than let em have it rubbish company no customer support new games full of cheating players this uplay is terrible i cant even access my account anymore it says sorry cant access uplay or ubisoft services are not currently available i am thinking of not using this garbage and un installing  store is better then this crap at least i can access my storei dont recommend anyone installing this crap im sad to admit that i have used uplay for far to many years now  tried to avoid it because it has always been a really poor experience but some of their games are too tempting but if you have any spine then avoid this storefront almost every purchase i have ever made here has caused me headaches and frustration gamekeys bought on steam vanishes and uplay will not compensate from dust some years ago another game bought on steam refuses to work  shuts down due to incorrect activation key anno 2070 not too long ago bought a game by accident 0 hours played no refund rayman legends  it said multiplayer so i would play it with my son but failed to mention it had to be locally on one machine and now i have bought an expansion for heroes of might and magic 6 but the game will not recognise it and keeps asking for an activation key  which i do not have in short it continues to amaze me how poor this storefront is it is slow buggy and the constant crashing of games or invalidation of games genuinely bought and paid for is just too much any other storefront is better more customer friendly less prone to frustration launcher is terrible connection probelms constantly if you can get the game through steam do that if i could rate uplay any lower i would it doesnt even deserve to see what a onestar review looks like this service gives you nothing but headaches and pains in your lower side oh you finally fixed the error after an hour of troubleshooting heres another one that makes you reinstall honestly if uplay continues to force people to use this awful interface i will storm the headquarters with an army of angry overweight gamers and burn it to the ground avoid at all costs watch dogs 2 is trash when it comes to direction ive been playing games for about 30 years now and have found frustration with direction but even when looking up the answers i can find out some shifty decision about how the players should be playing the game and i cant argue this game is like we wanted to be gta but there wasnt enough free information we could steal so we blame the customer but this cant be about the game because im not allowed to complain about anything specific but ubsifot as a whole try to deflect any bad reviews off anything because they dont want to learn they want to stay blissfully unaware about the opportunity to improve itselffeedback shouldnt be shunned it is a learning tool we are funking here because we loved you in the past and still have that glimmer of hope that you can become that company for us again so i dont use uplay for maybe 78years i forget my password i change my password still not working i change my password again i mightve made a typo i try again now my account is frozen because of too many attempts i think fine ill make another account not like theres anything on iti believe so far but no its my pc thats been banned from using ubisoft games temporarily sheitty service even worse than steam and even epic games should not exist my internet is out and uplay cant figure out how to go offline useless piece of software youd figure i could just put steam into offline mode and launch but no uplay has to get into the way just cant stand with how retrded the login system is i was trying to login to my old account forgot the password so reset it then logged in with the new password and your account is suspended waited for 15h and give it another try with the new password and the same st came up just fuking retrded and stupid how the game launcher is fix your servers i cant play r6s becuase i cant connect to them fix it asap ubisoft is a scamming company i wanted to purchase a game during sale i made the payment the amount was deducted from my account but an error came up saying transaction failed it happened twice its been more than a week now no response yet really disappointed with the experience it sucks  my account is suspended for an hour because i had 1 character in my email wrong  nothing but terrible ui unnecessary steps horrible servers and gimmicky moneygrubbing spam you guys need to fix your damn servers its getting ridiculous i shouldnt have to pay a thousand dollars for wifi just to not almost get kicked every fucking game i think it is bs that they got everyone on console hyped about the new hyperscape game and then only released it on pc they suck balls and there games are usually bs anyways i think everyone should boycott them not only is this the worst user experience ive ever seen with a buggy site that doesnt work but i cant play my games without logging in ok i change my password then the new password isnt recognized on the client so i cant log in ddosed on rainbow six seige for the third time you would think a new season would involve stopping this but no everytime ive contacted ubisoft they do nothing to help me rainbow six seige is full of online booters and drain hours of my time booting me from the game and making me lose mmr plus giving me abandonment penalties never once have they re paid me back my mmr or time useless i play rainbow six siege on pc and to run the game smoothly i have to open uplay but even after clicking on remember memy device it asks for login everytime i open it even after login it often crashes making me shut my game down on top of that recently i got blocked because uplay was failing to accept 2fa codes and they were all correct and i entered them correctly whoa glad i never paid them a dime  look at all the horrible reviews  well i downloaded their free offer of assassins creed discovery for egypt and greece  yup it was free to download and own in may  july 1 i suddenly need an activation code  what was given was taken away  i can only imagine the sort of dishonest thievery these bums apply once they have your money  caveat emptor to any suckers buying stuff from these maggots totaly useless aplication i hate all of your persons in company pls go de i just want to play my game what i bought  its such a problem or  totaly useless  ive paid 15 euros with my debit card for the monthly sub uplayyet after hours of playing they decided to suspend my account because they said that they never got my paymentget they took my money and i contacted my bank company and got the trasnaction numbers time date etcand i provided every files i had with the payment i didand yet they still decline that i paid themand they tried to charge me x4 times for 1 monthfor your own sake stay away from this trash company scamplaythey are legal thiefs with privillegesdont buy nothing from them cause they dont deserve nothingi no wonder anymore why people get pirate games instead of buying themits not about the money but its about their rotten system simmilar companies like scamsofti hope their end is near ubisoft will delete your account randomly and in doing so will say your account never existed n ever buy any game that has the ubisoft logo on it they dont care about their customers and dont give a squat about your hardware either they really should have learned their lesson with nfs rivals it was a really bad image for them they were saying you had to get an external hard for a system that had no ports for one all around horrible developer company ubisoft seems to have an issue with security as both of my accounts keep getting hacked despite me doing everything they say no other accounts i have with other companies have this issuehmmm and its unfortunate that contacting ubisoft is such a painful experience ive just given up having got nowhere with them this morning sort it out ubisoft first it was servers going down every two minutes now its just getting hacked every two minutes just lost my far cry blood dragon saves for no reason  played it once got to about the 3rd mission saved the game  booted it up again later and it said the cloud version wasnt the same as local so asked me to choose one  both had the exact same time stamp so i chose local  right back to the start of the gametotally inexcusable and i doubt ill risk playing any of the uplay games i own now  as a parent with limited time this is simply inexcusable and not a risk i will take again one of the worst support experiences i have ever had on chat the advisor didnt know what they were talking about no knowledge of the game i needed assistance with and was unable to escalate my issue they even ended the chat mid conversation ubisoft very bad launcher please remove this trash the people are horrible to deal with takes them days between responses absolutely awful company and especially the customer service i got an abandon sanction during a ranked game even though i hadnt played one before that and hadnt left so it wasnt possible and their customer service tried blaming me and kept deflecting the issue every time i told them its literally not possible ubiscamuplay double charged me twice for 1 month and ever since iv been trying to get a refund for being double chargedtried to contact them on multiable times via chat and they always said i needed proof which i have multiable times which they said its not proof which it isbank statement via screenshot nope need a real statment so i did via chat with a full copy statment and nope they said its not proof the bank statement stated i was double charged and they always change on what they want for proof just say i was scammed i paid twice for 1 monthall im going to say if you are new and wanting to try uplay then dont i was double charged when i was new and wanting to try out there ubiscam uplayjust dont you will be thankful if you only have money for 1 month and you need money for food then just stay away i was low on food due to ubisoft double charging me due to there scam tacticsits been all over reddit for years that they double charge new people then say ohh no we didnt you show proof and nope thats not proof due to this virus my bank has been closed so pretty much lost out on food moneythanks ubisoft for doing me overthis is why most people dislike you i hope the company dies ddosed from game lost mmr and banned from ranked because of a salty hard stuck gold 10 year old but its ok nothing will be done its ubisoft after all use to it the connection is terrible im not able to play just dance it offplease help me bought into the whole uplay idea thought it was great 1 month later  cant process my payment so after i ran all my damn cards 10 times finally it works and im getting a confirmation email except it never comes so i go to support first person tells me a lot of people are experiencing this issue at this time they are paying but it is taking a while to update they see that i have overpayed and will be refunding the overpayment i look at billing and noticed that it somehow changed to yearly and my payment was shown as null but account was active i wait 20 minutes and look again and now my payments are switched back to monthly but my account is now suspended i go back to support they act flabbergasted oh no suspended it has to do with my payment processing yet ive already been told it was accepted and overpayed this person is not saying lots of people are experiencing this issue but he is escalating my case and he will email me well if i could rely on the emails i would have gotten the confirmation for my first payment so i wouldnt have made 5 more so now here i am account suspended been a member for 7 years of ubisoft probably longer if you count other accounts that ive forgotten and cant even play the games i payed for guy cuts me off of chat thanks ubisoft no wonder your games are getting shittier every year спасибо за area f2 горите в адуthanks for area f2 burn in hell would give this company zero stars purchased just dance but was unable to play due to their controller app crashing when i requested a refund for the 12 month subscription id prepaid since i was unable to play the game it was refused they instead sent me to apple and sony will not be purchasing anything else from this company buggy games and terrible customer service im not sure whats wrong with this company but i had to register multiple times before i could get in and even buy it they declined my credit card with no reason most of their system has very very bad explanations when something fails so i used paypal instead and it workedwhen i finally finished downloading my 30gb game i clicked launch and it went to running then back to launch again didnt load the game i restarted epic games same problem restarted computer same problem went to open uplay to see if i have to load there says my account is suspended for too many logins this was my first time loading uplay not sure how i have too many attempts after 1  i can only assume trying to load the game was attempting a bad login behind the scenes but not sure  now what  i have to wait for my uplay account to be unsuspended  i tried resetting my password but nothingcertainly there could be user error here but without adequate messages i dont know whats going on  i dont know why the games arent loading i dont know why my account is being suspended for bad logins after just one login  its just been a nightmare experience compared to steam always a connection error even with their help on check this and that ffs its been like this on and off even if the game is free its not worth opening uplay anymoe bought ac odyseey on epic and didnt realize u need uplay i was screwed when seeing this i hope the likes of steam or epic buys you and get rid of that horrific uplay crap i just wanted a very simple change on a preorder but they made it so complicated and then they completely ignored me until now when i asked for updates my sons account was permanent banned while he was away in the hospital undergoing surgery and truants for a condition he was not the one playing the game as his account was hacked by one of my other childrens friends we did not find out what happened until recently i contacted ubisoft customer support through chat since they are too shady to let you call them anymore i explained the situation and told them he had spent over 200 on the game that he earned selling lemonade and doing other jobs for people within a couple of hours they came back and said that the ban will not be lifted not very fair to someone who didnt do whatever it was that caused the ban in the first place terrible terrible company i will be taking this issue to the highest level that is basically stealing his money no wonder more than 90 of people only give this company a 1 star what a fing scam even on free games they ask you to launch uplay and then ask for an activation key imagine buying a product instead never being sent an activation key and never recieving the product by far the worst launcher and company that ive come across probably the worst company on the planet after ea one of those game studio companies that totally destroyed the gaming industry and has zero credibility they make promises that are not kept never deliver what was said at the start of each title charge the game plus microtransactions and that would all be all right if their games actually work well most of them are in some prebeta state no communication with the customers customer support can only copypaste generic answers patches are very slow and usually destroy the game even further whatever they touch it gets destroyed and they are also horrible towards their community they already lost lots of money recently due to treating customers like trash for many years so if they dont change anything drastically it will be a financial disaster for themi was a supporter for many years never got punished banned or anything so i can speak what is on my mind freely without of a grudge now i feel they are in the top 2 worst companies for the past 20 yearsubisoft you suck badly assasin odesey a very bad gamea lot of stupid quest for nottingyou have to speed up the game its to slow red redemtion 2 and god of war its much better and the quest are more faster i will never buy another ubisoft game banned for developer glitch way to go massive doesnt even deserve 1 star i downloaded monopoly family fun pack and i cant even get past the create a uplay account part because it keeps on coming up with an error total waste of money been a fan of most of the games the company made but poor management and even worse customer service is making me realize just how bad the company is and how it doesnt listen to its customers they made watch dogs 2 and it was more crappy than the  1st one in the money truck eventpvp for money and they b teaming should that not be illegal and the respond is long as everthats not fairrr this game is huge blow of money  if i could give negative stars i would worst customer service also an in game exploit has been circulating causing the wrong people to be banned fix your own game before you lose over half your customer base you just burned down your last bridge last time i ever spend money on  ubisoft game developers are arrogant and beyond unhelpful customer service have nothing in their hand useless in another word very untrustworthy operationthey ban your account a week for no reason just because they can and you have to live with it never ever experienced worse than that do not trust this company with your time or money extremely unethical avoid their products this company put on the market crap games they know that and they refuse to refund when youd tried everything they asked you to do on your pc to finally admit that there is something wrong they are unable to fix stay away from these scammers terrible company rainbow is the most broken game ever 5 years on and they even fix a normal mmr gain issue r6s most fxcked up game ever that doesnt need to be fxck ubi how can a 9figure a year game get worse with udates fxcked in the head  matchmaking is 4ss greater concept sshit devs terrible company wanted me to send them my photo id in order to close my account very unhelpful overseas customer service no phone number to call as if im going to send my photo id to some total stranger they refused to use my security questions to verify my identity isnt that the whole point of security questions will never use this company again and am closing sons account as well uplay store is in short appalling i recently purchased tom clancys the division 2 which is a pretty decent game but the pain and hell i experienced was shocking once i had purchased it i thought it would be like any run of the mill game service experience but no my account was charged and the game did not appear in my library for at least one and a half hours which in itself is not too too bad but the fact that the receipt didnt even show up in the purchases tab is on a whole other level well it did eventually appear just after the game itself showed up in my library the only okay thing about it is that it has fairly good download serversin the end i would not recommend anyone use this service thank god i read the reviews before subscriber to uplay bunch of waers should be ashamed of yourselves ubisoftor do you just think your company is too big to bother listening to your customers anymore note you havent even bothered to reply to  any negative comments either which is always a sure fire way of saying we couldnt care less purchased uplay sub on 21820 tried to dl ghost recon breakpoint same day but dl kept crashing no phone  to call ubisoft so opened trouble ticket and requested refund they wont refund and we never used it and couldnt dl game very disappointed and frustrated purchased div 2 on 14022020 and still waiting for the game to be added to my libraryunable to log into support page or live chat today 26022020 will ask for a refund shortly worst company to every buy from they have this awful security measure where if you try to many of your passwords you get suspended for an hour if they had a warning it would be alright taking hours to play a game you own 110 not necessary in the slightest worst authorisation system ever experienced awful shlllt avoid if possible trash company your unity engine is trash and you make players wait 6 months for resolutions with no eta players paying for subscriptions that get no benefits support is useless and your games of full of glitches that never ever gets fixed90 of this sites reviews states the service and company is bad downloaded a 5601gb of a 5602gb game got an ambiguous error and had to redownload terrible application avoid if possible have about 4 games by ubisoft that dont work correctly the most recent being ghest recon breakpoint the optical sights stopped working and the game logs out from the ubisoft server then takes a very long time before it will  allow you to sign back in i will never recommend ubisoft to anyone extremely awful experience with payment delay and missing digital content delivery customer service only manage to respond repetitively with the same lineafter all the games ive purchased through out the years this is the worst experience so far how on earth are this company still in trade  what a disgrace they are  i cannot access a number of ubisoft  games on steam which i have bought over the years due to me in error opening a new ubisoft account for a game i bought a couple of weeks ago  i can play that game no problem but cannot access or play any of the ones on my older account  bearing in mind i own these games  trying to get them to understand the issue and resolve it has been a nightmare and is still not resolved and ive heard nothing over three days despite messaging them several times on my open casehow difficult can it be to allow me access to my games  ive sent them proof of purchase as requested etc etc and nothingworse than useless  im at the point of cutting my losses telling them where to go and what to do with their shocking customer service closing my accounts deleting their games off my steam account and never ever spending another penny on any of their products i cant play r6s all its doing is showing me its working then it kicks me for a conection error and it just loops it just loops i accidentally unistalled a uplay game from my compter which i had no problems downloading priori tried reinstalling the same game again and it only downloads to 13 then completely stopscontacted customer service only to keep getting templated emails back linking to faqsissue is still unresolved and i deactivated my accounti will never buy from this company again uplay crashes my gamer6 siege in ranked and then bans me for leaving in the middle of the match ive sunk 900 hours into siege im done now uninstalled the game  and feel like a weight has been lifted such a great game ruined by atrocious managementf ubisoft im installing apex legends i honestly havent come here out of rage to bad mouth a company for its misfortunes rather complete disappointment anyone could tell breakpoint was released to early and was rushed incomplete and riddled with glitches bad animation and almost no story line worth following  to be able to complete the boss fight before ever reaching the required level to do so is a joke  imagine finishing a glass e before youve even played half of it  but now after 6 months of waiting for any interesting content and it now unplayable hours of downloading and months of waiting for what another rushed product inferior to its competition  i will never buy again from  this company and would never recommend to a friend complete joke of a company ive deleted the game and all other ubisoft products tanks for waistingj my entire day ubisoft is a horrible company  i bought anno 1800 and was really looking forward to it  once i started playing and building a fleet of ships i realized that they only follow orders about half of the time and were constantly bugging out and sailing right into enemy harbors  i knew very quickly that it was so buggy it was an unplayable game so i contacted customer support to return the game and get my money back  less than 48 hours after purchasing it  they told me there was nothing they could do and essentially i was stuck with it  since when could you sell someone a complete piece of crap and not allow them to return it this is the worst place ever everything they try to redo they make it 100 worse rainbow six siege is one of the worst games ive ever played in my life whenever someone isnt in my screen they kill me but when i shout them they take no damage ubisoft is absolute trash fuc sht dont bother with it just created a fuc account and keeps saying its been suspended suspend my knob uplay i just want to play monopoly with my boyfriend cnts a pile of dog poo toxic games toxic ai todos drvs toxic company yoy should all kill yourselfs or quit every game is a pile of camel penises breakpoint is embarrassing the glitches the sliding the story the people non stop coughing so much more this hurts to have to send this bad review i really enjoyed ubisoft games this is the fallout 76 of ubisoft uplay launcher is terrible it consumes 35 of my cpu time when idle or in the background when running games this is especially annoying because every drop of cpu time is needed to run ubisofts typically highly cpu demanding games such as the assasins creed series force closing the uplay application gives noticable improvement in frametimes and less stutters across multiple games im running an i74790k clocked at 49 ghz on all cores this launcher is terrible if a game loads up at all there is a good chance that it doesnt function properly  when i looked it up every answer i saw was uninstall and reinstall  how about fixing your product  i bought a special edition of a game that was supposed to come with a copy of another game which never showed up  when i asked about it the response is oh we knowwhat the hell  every answer from every person is our system is terrible just deal with it the digital platform uplay is beyond ridiculous had a game for less than 24 hours and because of technical issues wanted to return it system specs were way higher than recommended after having to send all my system diagnostics to them they returned with a well get back to you when we canno time frame finally they came back that all digital content sales are final why would anyone support a company that has such poor policies and customer service lets bankrupt these guys theyll never get another penny from me one star it too much there should be a 0 as wellfor a discount key which they did not emailand claim they did exchanged 5 emails in which it was not possible for them to find it or verify it existed at all it takes 4 days for each email exchange until the discounts of the christmas season ended and i missed the game then i found a note of the code later and tried it so it existed and they do not know how to find itdecent services would immediately offer an apology and a replacement or something instead of frustrating their customers and using their timeit was a mistake to skip steam and try uplay never again ive had the worst experience on this launcher one of the worst launchers and the company tries to stay uninvolved with anything of their own wont listen to the community and their forums go untouched all the problems ive had are always either fixed by someone online or just fix themselves would rate less than 1 star avoid ubisoft they will rob you and then you will have to get through impenetrable wall of first line support who will fob you off with a script the worst customer service i have ever come across oh and if you try do a paypal charge back they will block your account they will probably block me for this how do they get away with it just dont deal with them ever requested to delete my personal information out of forum got an answer but when i asked them again about after a month since my information wasnt deleted by then as they promised they just ghosted me beyond bad customer support and password policy keeps forgetting my login and the password rules are so complex that i keep forgetting the password this means every single time im trying to play it bans my account for an hourhonestly go fu cks yourselves guys your so called security policies are in fact forcing people to store passwords in clear text files ive seen it with so many people suffering from the same problem the way i was spoken to by ubisoft representative  ubidvergr is sickening i was double charged again and he showed absolutely no understanding for why this might upset me he was rude passive aggressive  inconsiderate before deliberately cutting me off what kind of company is this i felt like i was dealing with the mafia always check your bank statement because ubisoft will double charge you if you can get your games or services elsewhere save yourself the drama and do it yes they are terrible i provided all of the information they requested in my original case opening comment i needed them to transfer a game from one of my accounts to the other 4 days 5 representatives and 20 messages later and they transferred the wrong version of the game to the account now theyre again asking for information i have already provided the right version of the game is in the ubisoft store all they have to do is remove the current version and add that version they are absolutely terrible its like pulling teeth they all have indian names also so support is being outsourced to nonnative countries where they can pay them less they get what they pay for worst launcher ever i get logged out ever 3 damb minutes i put in the correct password and they lock me out of my account cant even play a damn game because of it crashing so damn much locked me out of all of my accounts because google authenticator which isnt even connected to uplay mind you wasnt giving me the right code to unlock the 2step authentication which has never been set up in the first place baffled no email no apology just thanks for your purchase generated mail ive waited more then 3 weeks send alot of emails and still get no personal email just some bot saying thanks for your putchase very poor i spend alot of money on you ubisoft fk outa here im not buying ur garbage anymore you lost a loyal costumer by being so bad at customer service first ive waited hella long and now i get such an impersonal mailgarbage ubisoft continues to allow cheaters to play ghost recon wildlands and breakpoint when you are in pvp matches especially in ranks game they dummy down all the players you report same old cheating players and they dont do nothing about it i bought wildlands and breakpoint thinking they would aleast control the cheats in pvp evidently they just want your money without kicking or taking rank away from cheaters bought a game from the ubi store and it isnt showing on uplay clearly an ongoing issue that they prefer to blame on the purchase method kinda crazy that you buy a digital game and dont receive it immediately no support no refunds for nonworking games and services fug swindlers from ubisoft not recommeneded at all dont buy anything in theit pseudostore if you dont want a problems after i tried going offline for the 10th time i give up i logged in did second security questions and then i still was online i just want to go offline god damnit uplay is just as buggy and useless as ubishwoft friggin useless and 99 of the time it isnt even working the way it shouldwell played buggysoft worst refund policy ever so they cant refund an in game purchase when the made the game literally my little brother accidentally bought in game currency while my card was on my account and they cant do anything about it so dumb and disappointing appalling it is slow often problems games disappear for no reason then show up again what is wrong with this thing glad i do not have many games on it will be avoiding ubisoft games with all the problems they cause it just boggles the mind how bad uplay iswow there is to much about this company that deserves a bad review scummy micro transaction grubbing extreme racism and abuse in game that the company does absolutely nothing about store forces you into selecting the wrong country and no other choices trash servers  they dont do anything about it  definitely do not buy any game from ubisoft  they are teash this companys services are not different than scam there is no way to solve your issue with customer support and even i suspect there are really people behind of the support who are reading your problems all the answers are copypaste and definetely without a solution moreoever they are confirming the refund but of course it is a big lie since there is no any payment back further to that you cant get the service you paid for in conclusion you should stay away from this company if you dont want to have a hearth attack takes your money wont let you play uplay and their payment system is full of  bugs stay away this company is very hard to get a hold of also they are way to expensive 15 monthlygive me a break   you need more options back to steam this company doesnt even make good games anymore stop buying things from thembest part is they could release the best game ever now and i still wouldnt buy it because i want this company to go down so badi guess they get the epic treatment from me bought a game with uplay 33 days later still waiting for the game or my money back not conformable to the german law support either incompetent or unwilling worst support ever periodfiled a complaint trash fire every person that works there and rehire them money grabbers that sell half finished products and charge you every tome they can this is by far the worst gaming company out there even worst than epicgames they literally dont listen to there players they dont know how to balans a game just look at for honor i just deleted it out of frustration its terrible it went from being a game where you needed actual skill to a game where if you have hyper armor or lightspam you win my favorite carracter was and still is lawbringer but they nerfed him to the point where he is useless and the carracters who dont need af buff they give a buff like raider he has one of the fasted lights in the game hyper armor and decent heavies and so this brilliant company decides to give him even more hyper armor while its totally unnessecary the community has been asking for hyper armor for lawbringer for so long but they just ignore us and do what ever they want its really understandable that this is the most hated game companyi hope you see this cause im fng annoyed and you probaly dont care about this but you are ruining everything for yourselves and you company is gonna with a bad reputation i wish i could have gave this a 0 to be sure you diots understand that it means zero terrible waited 15 months for support i never received the game i bought do not buy ghost recon i want my money back worst game of 2019 the company is very misleading especially with their new uplay scamthe company hides the unsubscribe page by sending you to a page that sayssorry to see you go then in a much smaller font scroll down to confirm cancellation then refuse to refund the money even when queries the first day they take the moneywill never spend a penny on a ubisoft product again as i dislike their practices i tried to log in to my account couldnt because of a 2step authenticator which doesnt work at all they keep sending me mails telling me to disable the authenticator in my account settings which i cant reach because i cant login wont let you go to offline mode when there is no internet wont let you play sp games offline and when you finally get internett again stops you from playing service unavailable yet every other service like steam etc worksreferring to uplay and assassins creed odyssey absolutely worthless tried to install siege which was released 4 years ago now first had to uninstall and reinstall the game then uninstall and reinstall uplay then it finally worked but you have to spend 50 to even get 4 of the 16 some odd operators in the game oh you wanted to do that too bad because trying to purchase anything in game will fail both in the ubisoft store and the steam store itll tell you your credit card is bad i tried 4 different payment options all totally clear when i checked my accounts no dice and finally i gave up and tried to just go back to the game that was working 10 minutes ago to play with the stock operators i didnt need to buy nope now when i try to play it tells me it cant authenticate that i own the game that i was literally playing 10 minutes ago ubisoft has got to be the most collectively incompetent developer group i have ever dealt with constant crashes i am never going to buy another game that has to run on their server the game im trying to play was released 2 years ago and theyre still patching it and having problems contacting customer support gets you nowhere no matter how many things you try that they tell you to there is no way around using their server if you play a game on pc i bought it through steam why cant i just play it through them ubisoft is the most unreliable useless and broken company ive ever encountered all i want is to play the game that i purchases but i guess thats too much to ask for such a bad company talking to them is like pulling teeth if you can even get in contact at all rainbow six siege is probably the worst game i have ever played and im not over exaggerating ive tried  multiple times to explain what was going on when i was playing and i got told to  record my gameplay and put it on youtube  terrible customer service purchased division 2 and have been attempting to download it as i dont want to sit and watch the download i do it overnight uplay times out and the download stops been trying for two days of course its digital and unlike steam they wont refund my money will never buy another ubisoft game you cant even play with two people it just makes one person play and the other person just gets to do nothing and i was going to play with my brother but it just glitched out for a 5th time cant play my game without a fcing useless ubisoft club bullsht so fuin dumb i had one for xbox but reset pw doesnt even f9ckin send so f8cking dumb the worst support experience ever made with a company they will never see my money again got my account hijacked today spent over 200 hours each game and 120 on the account i go to support and guess what they cant do anythinggo fk youre selfs ubisoft you nasty cnts ubisoft is the worst at matchmaking and team balancing time and time again it never fails i wont be using their service or any of their games any longer really bloaty and slowhorrible connection problems all the time to start the division 2 can take ages or demand a reboot of the computerif i could i would give it a zeroarrogant and really bad costumer service toavoid if possible worst ever ubisoft big fails should be the name of your company far cry new dawn on ps4 many bugs where the game doesnt continue the worst ai enemie in the final battle you did create a match in an environment screen blacked out 95 of the time its impossible at all to see an enemie while confonted to this enemie which you cant see at all this opponent snipers you continuously even though you are running jumping arround plus staying stuck all the time because  you cant see nothing at all so you are dead before finding the enemie good job ubisoft you should consider creating cooking shows let me tell you the best in this  final match even not finding the enemie because you cant see anything you get attacked by dogs d omg you just hear them because they dont appear on your screen the view is so badly programmed you have to take a look at your feet to see the dog d  lmfao and than you suddenly fall dead to the ground because in all of this you cant notice that you have no energy left second best the enemies through smoke grenades you cant see them but they see you offcourse and can kill you easily i have rarely played a game which did make me angry at a point to destroy my complete house my suggestion buy an other game this one is not worth our time i bought division 2 and they took a week to even ship the game and when i asked why they didnt the reply i got was its 23 working days after they send it not 23 working days from the purchases which is bull and then later told me i couldnt get a refund until they shipped it out to me and then i sent it back even tho they still had the game with them and took my money  personally i will never buy from them ever again and would never recommend anyone buy it from them i bought rainbow six and i got banned for hacking but i was int hacking bought a game and cant download it it says there are issues downloading pc games when paying via paypal and they are working on it why let me buy it then 4 hours later and still no game avoid avoid avoid asked paypal for refund which could take 20 days  terrible first experience of ubisoftuplay wont use again terrible bought games and now i cant even play them because a ubisoft server is currently unavailable attempted to trouble shoot for days with no luck dont waste your time with this joke of a company disgusting service and support ticket 08470807 ignored by you for one and a half months terrible company they have permanently banned me for toxic behaviour in rainbow six siege 6 months ago without any previous warning or clear policy that when people will be permanently banned in this game what is the clear tresshold for toxicity i had a very old account i was an old player of this game so after a time i got many reports they have manually checked my profile and decided to ban me forever i have never experienced such bad behaviour from other companies i have appealed my ban then they refused to tell me what was exactly the reason i got perma ban on my account after 6 months i tried to appeal again they refused to unban me and said i wont be unbanned ever and they still refuse to tell me what is the exact reason i got bani have never experienced such thing before in games i was never banned in any multiplayer game for cheating or toxicity i got only chat bans in other game that is all it is terrible how this company handle the so called toxicity in their games when their mute option or other games ban your chat option that is all but it is terrible they give perma ban to players without any warning and handling them on the same level as cheatersi had even bought extra stuff to r6 so i didnt not only lose my account but much money i have spent on their game because i wanted to support this terrible company i will never ever buy any game from them in the future or giving to them any money that is surebasically they have stolen my money because i could easily play with other account on other pc and ip address they just took my money and if i wanna play it again i have to start with a clear account and buying everything again they are just greedy no more ubisht for me f ubbisoft its so hard just to get in gameyou need activation code that doesnt appears and aggghh f it awful got game for free for buying new processor experienced less then a few minutes of uplay and decided screw the game deviance 2 as uplay was utter crap ill never play or buy a game that uses uplay i unfortunately never buy games from ubisoft anymore because i have encountered so many problems with uplay i stick with steam and will not even consider buying games that have to run through uplay uplay sucks randomly ask for the verification code and the verification codes cannot be used cant contact the user support ive uninstalled it and lose my four games due to my log in problem better stick to steam it seem the most horrible round about lets make chase a goose and do all of the work for attitude for customer service support the service is even worse than in origin you cant even buy 18 games before 11pmubisoft server are instable as never seen played rainbow six siege but then suddenly perm banned for toxic behaviour i ask what kinda evidence of my toxic behaviour do you have and they basically tell me we cant give u that information while its my own account seems like they just randomly perm ban people for nothingedit they banned me for cheating after i complained about it i asked the support about it and told me it was gonna be fixed its been 24 hours and still got the cheating ban what a shockingly bad support team still no response from them regarding a purchase i made on uplay not available to me even though i purchased it through uplay and have the invoice to prove it tried contacting them by email and phone 4 days later still nothing the support is useless called at 15 swedish time on a thursday but noone answers and the phone service should be open cuz the opening times is 1319 at monfrireally sitty service this isnt even about customer service its just about the game for honor fung fix the servers jesus christ how fuing hard is it to keep 8 players in a 20 minute game without someone with great connection getting kicked out when seconds away from winning a hard fought match dont buy from them they just dont care about their customers they just dont they just want your money and to keep our mouths shut had a bad experience with the seriousness of the support they didnt care about my word they only listen to what the computers have to say the games are glitchy full of exploits they ban who is not hacking or not seriously while there are guys teleporting through the map killing everyone in the preperation phase and they dont carehonestly ubisoft get good if it was possible i would rate 0 stars this is easily the worst company for buying video games i bought assassins creed odyssey the game was completely broken to the point where it would crash every time i opened it i asked for a refund since i tried all fixes i could find and nothing worked and they offered me more fixes and said i cant get a refund just be i opened thegame how else am i going to determine wether or not i want to keep the game so there goes 50 thanks to their retardedly strict refund policy i thought streams refund policy was bad but at least they let you try the game you bought before it becomes nonreturnable when i tk someone who tkes me i get banned how is this fair ubisoft is bad scum of the earth closing in on ea as the greediest most unethical games company operating today i have zero sympathy for this generation of gamers allowing themselves to be swindled by this ilk the servers for all games have been very poor dedicated servers are suppose to fix the issue but some how still the games lag and crash or just dont connect at all very disappointed in this potato called ubisoft yall hype games up and cant keep the fans because they feel like you could give two shots and a fly about the servers no wonder yall only have a 1 star rating in disgusted the huge amount of detail equals the huge amount of bugsglitches which makes every single ubisoft game useless and frustrating what a pain in the a this trash launcher is i almost gave 2 stars because their launcher helped find my keyboard started to miss keystrokes by failing my login enough to lock my account out i decided to give 1 though because when i contacted their live support they told me to shove my request up my a and wait the full hour or so this launcher constantly logs me out when i supposedly have it saved to log me in automatically and am forced to recredential every couple of days i havent had to relog my steam account since i upgraded before that it was half a f decade dont force people to use a sh client when a better option is readily available or fix your hot trash of an application to industry standards alternatively you could have a support team with actual tools and not copy paste lip service you have so many options i literally just made a ubisoft account and i try to access the account management and it said that the account is invalid and then i exit out of the website and load it back up and now it wont even allow me to login because it says my account is invalid i tried to make a new account yet again with the exact same information and it said that the account is already in use so i have no idea whats going on because im very upset at them that i just bought a 3999 dollar game that i cant even play because it requires a ubisoft account that i cant even access when i just made it i have 3 games in my uplay account all of them worked i had to reinstall windows and now 2 of the games ghost recon wildlands and the new far cry 5 give me the same error upon launch access denied i contacted the support line and spent 20 days now going back and forth with them they cannot solve my issue and i have run out of patience with their stupid try this or that all they have to do is re issue the game to me and it would work i sent them a receipt and everything worst customer service ever i have 50 games in my steam account and this has never happened to a single game running through steam i feel like they stole my money and i have no one to turn too beyond frustrated i have no way to contact the company other than online support and now that after 20 days i am refusing to trouble shoot this for them any longer they will not proceed claiming i have refused to troubleshoot i have logged over 18 hours and 20 days back and forth with themwhere do you draw the lineridiculous the servers are always bugged uplay is the hitler on launchers for games every game in six siege match i go in it says must be connected it pisses me off so much ubi fix your damn servers anyone who have plans for buying far cry 5 please dont the game is unbelievably abysmal this game is undoubtedly the biggest trailer bait game ive seen in 2018 there are countless moments when enemies appear out of nowhere and kill you on the spot no matter how equipped you are the fact that you cant heal yourself and need to grab a med kit in order to regenerate your health is a massive insult toe all the previous far cry games in the trailer all the characters who were going to guide you through the storyline are hardly in the game after you clear john seeds region and the main villains aside from jacob seed are not crazy or villainous enough like vaas montenegro and pagan minhonestly i would much prefer they would make a sequel to far cry 3 bringing jason brody back as the main character because far cry primal and most of far cry 4 didnt live up to be better than number 3 i had big hopes for this game and i was overwhelmed with excitement but after a few weeks playing this insult of a game i never want to buy another far cry game that comes after number 5 luckily far cry 3 has been remastered so at least ubisoft and their developers arent entirely gormless but they definitely need to pull their heads out of their arses and make give the fans what they really wantps screw you ubisoft ive never seen a 1 star rating but ubisoft deserves this it is clearly the worst publisher only defending ea also they dont let you post unless you give personal information so you can assume there would be way more 1 stars uplay is an absolute disaster how the hell am i experiencing problems launching a game ive already put 12 hours into i have been working for hours to get far cry 5 to launch on my pc yes my pc can handle it and ive done everything in my power to make sure its not anything on my side of things that is preventing the game from launching uplay has absolutely no benefits or pros to it that steam doesnt already have so ridiculous that uplay is even in existence worst application ive ever come across and of course i cant just call a support number i have to bend over backwards giving them cpu and file info before my questions will even be considered utter failure ditch uplay entirely such a shame that ive wasted 3 hours doing this instead of playing a good game if there truly is something on my side that can be fixed id be happy to leave a better review but as of right now with the abilities and knowledge that i have this isnt on me i never wished more for bunkruptcy than for this peice of trahs company the just dont do the job they promised to never had so much bad experiences in my entire gaming life as with this company regarding game and online gaming stability customer service nearly unexistentand btw uplay is the most useless overlay i have ever laid eyes on blizzard pls buy them and do the fcking job terrible customer service absolutely no help they try to push the issue elsewhere and make retailers handle their game problems they will politely tell you that they are unwilling to help you when you press the issue ill never buy anything with a ubisoft logo again this is coming from a 10 year customer they make some good games but force you to use uplay for them all i can no longer start my games in steam as uplay is blocking them and they crash on launch if i turn uplay into offline mode they launch but then will not let me start a new game as i need to be connected to the internet scam in the name of drm and hurting people who buy the games the people who pirate the games are playing them while i still have not resolved this after a week with the support team i am locked from my account because i tried to log in too many times with wrong password event though i have reseted the password no consumer support cant login cant play any of my games onlineall of my money is wasted tried everything but they just dont care bought farcy 5 only to be charged twice recent update deleted my dlc and poor customer service also the season pass does not tell you when purchasing that this is for future content dlc leading you to think you are buying something you can use right awayonly after delving into various forums was i made aware that i have essentially paid for nothingwith the last update the few items i did have have now vanished and a week later this widely known issue is still not being addressed but they are still taking peoples money for non existent contentessentially this games was not finished the lag is horrible and makes the game unplayablethey are bordering on conmen and refuse to refund for their mistakes if i pay for something and you then take it away from me without me giving permission you are stealingluckily i bought this on amazon who kindly refunded me fully as ubisoft customer service was a waste of time i recommend all of you do this full refund absolutely the worst developer ive had the misfortune of buying a game from they are unresponsive unintuitive and clueless ive had countless issues with logging into my account and unacceptable server conditions this may sound dramatic but i loathe them this stupid f company will not let me register on anything because it says my username is invalid and my password is invalid when i f validated it and my email is invalid also f you be soft and other games what a waste of time they told me they failed to authenticate my farcry4 account made me do a two step verification process so i changed my password and then tried to do the google authentication code process but it failed even thought they sent me this through my email if they would send this through my email why in the hell do i have to punch in that damn code on top of that i cant call to fix this issue so i have to wait who knows how long until they get back to me to play a game i paid 30 bucks for wt i should just have downloaded a pirated version and bypass this bull when i had play prince of persia i always thought ubisoft game is trash and developers woundnt hv any future such game are failure most likely prince of persia in some stage i stuck even game start from last checkpoint and we cant do anything to start game from begining dont know how to fix games r6 every update rainbow 6 turns into a casspool of toxic  players that abuse over powered oporators revert back to year one i would rather sit on a flaming sword than buy another game that uses this server ubisoft is the worst gaming server from for honor to anno 2070 and its still crap i just dont understand how a bunch of nerds can make such awesome games sucks so much this company makes good lookin games  but not really  their servers are extremely trash and their games are hella broken for example r6s is broken asf and hitbox are not fix etc and another example  for honor is so unbalanced one charater is more op then the other charater so if u a new player in that game  u are just gonna be raging ur whole time wit da game same as the other one    the division is ok but hella boring  so my conclusion of this company is the games are nice but ur gonna be raging spent 40 min trying to figure out what my account got suspended for all i wanted to do was play far cry 4 with my best friend maybe skin some endangered animals for a bit but naw i made a new account with a new email and when i logged out for literally about 5 min it logged me into my about 2 year old account it ruined my night possible my weekend ruined my friends night ruined my mood i cried out of frustration who who in their right mind would make such a complicated system and label it as convenient towards users yves guillemot michael guillemot christian guillemot gerard guillemot claude guillemot and whoever is remotely related to those main five please die and for people reading this if you see a game that looks fun like for honor but see that its made my ubisoft dont buy it spent hundreds on games and was permanently banned with no explanation when i contacted customer support for support they said they have no information yet the ban would not be lifted they are basically thieves beware in one word avoid ive ordered my my product 3 weeks ago i still havent  received anything yet did not receive any answered from there online support by far the worst buying experience ive had in years  servers suck  u better fix those stupid servers needs to be a 0 star option terrible customer service yet another customer who hasnt received their item through ubisoft faux dhl service and no response or follow up from staffs in weeks despite numerous complaints horrible company i play phone destroyer and have to wait 4 hours and then win 3 battles to open a pack then i go to open the pack and it says if you battle you will lose your pack and has one single button that says open pack i press open pack it takes e straight to battle and i lose my pack this happens alot i write support and they say your issue has been forwarded  if you dont reply we mark your issue as solved then i go to login to reply  it says your password is incorrect you have been locked out change y password and ask them if there will be any resolution they dont reply ive went through all of this 3 times now ok i thought they were bad with assassins creed origins with their not allowing you to get the original assassins creed outfit without the master assassins achevement but then they offer black flag as a supposed christmas gift to ppl but offer it only to pc users what a piece of dung company play favorites with the pc and ignore console users wellfrack you too its not all about pc or even systems you offer it to one you do the same for all this is unfair treatment on the highest lvthe worst part was the lead on we could all get it it was never explained when the news was first released it was pc only i and a lot of others feel falsely led on their software especially their launcher uplay are terrible pieces of software that will have untold compatibility issues with other programs or even with themselves their support is terribly poorly prepared to handle any issue and will try to beat their customers to exhaustion by giving repetitive solutions that they know will not solve anything buy their products if you dare but know that you will bitterly regret it when the issues start affecting you and youre left alone with no help at all if i could give ubisoft 0 stars i would absolutely awful customer servicetech support i got logged out of my ubisoft account despite having it highlighted to save my login information upon return it didnt save my email or password now i have an account that still shows up but i cant play on ive tried reaching out to ubisoft for almost a week now with absolutely no word back form them also they have a tech support number to call which relays you back to their website which is almost useless they have numerous hyperlinks on their help page that literally take you back to the same page you clicked the hyperlink onone of if not the worst company ive had the displeasure of trying to contact i pre orded assassins creed origins gold received the wrong game which was not my fault 3 weeks later and i have still not received the game or come any closer to getting it they cannot sent me assassins creed or give me a refund until they get the wrong game back i send them a ticket 2 weeks ago and still not had a response every few matches i get kicked out connection to server lost aint my networks fault ubisoft will send stuff through deutsche post now as deutsche post  owns dhl theyll use the dhl logoeven thought its a different company i found this out chasing a tracking number ubisoft emailed me calling every office until the  deutsche post uk office could find it on their system this means if you buy anything from ubisoft store youll pay for a service your not getting ive been waiting almost a day now to hear something back from ubisoft nothing yet    2nd time ive had issues with ubisoft i will never touch a ubisoft product again ubisoft has by far the worst customer support i have ever experienced in my entire life just spent 20 days trying to change my email whilst waiting up to 4 days for a bloody reply the person i was stuck talking was an absolute dumbass if i could give less than 1 star i wouldnt hesitate the worst servers among the gaming historyneglecting the fact that they have good games but the servers diminish that all for vainworst company ever uplay is a piece of hiti bought a game on steam which i cant play becouse uplay crashes on the start well done their matchmaking is dog crap in rainbow six seige we got lower tier golds going up against daimonds and platinum all in all fucc you ubisoft so a game is freeim then explained my full price purchase will be given as a pomotional codeyou get this promotional code in 2 weeks time and it expires 1 week latermany games with 50 discount the time of purchase expire before you get the promotional codeno i double checked the dates of expiration are not to be found anywherealso i have 2 accounts by accident segregating my games this was due to the name change from ubi to uplay and the login being faulty this wasnt good enough to merge my 2 accounts created under my name their response was steam wouldnt do this for me either bashing on the competition i bet they would do this for me if they changed their name and the login wasnt working with correct name and password do not buy games from this company they are the worst things you can pay 60 dollars to they have horrid customer service do not listen to what consumers still buy their games and cant make a good game to begin with my experience was with rainbow a flawless game to start that they jumped killed and threw in a ditch due to trash updates horrid hit detection and a major lack to fixes worst customer service i have ever experienced one month of communicating and very little help ubisoft is honestly the worst game company company inn history whether its due to their use of microtransactions poor servers in almost every game they create horrific customer service or overall crap games with one or two minor exceptions typically ive never had an issue with any game company but ubisoft is just that terrible avoid them at all costs i preordered a game realizing i paid right away tried to have it cancel and ubisoft just wont let it happen an 80 game ending paying 100 really rubbish company charge you a fortune and then leave you hanging doesnt trust its own audience to do right by them crucially because they expect to produce bad games and therefore need to ensure that users can be shut down remotely control their game play or just to ensure that those 001 of pirates cant get access to their games which they always can of course they ensure that always online is required and that leaves the rest of us fued when they eventually as they always do because customer service is not a priority marketing is let us down i hate you ubisoft almost as much as i loathe ea they ir the worst  terrible probably 90 of the time you cant even launch their games and even when they have common bugs they dont fix them just use steam ubisoft ducking sucks worst multiplayer game connection ever literally get disconnected from more games than i actually play through and progress doesnt even get recorded until the end so i end up essentially wasting an hour at a time just trying to get 1 game that counts toward anything server connection is the worst ive ever encountered will never buy an ubisoft game again i placed an order and received the wrong item i sent it back and now im going on one month since i returned it and still havent gotten a refund or exchange rainbow six siege error code 30x0001000bagainagain  when a common issue does not get fixed and as a result denies the player from 100 completion this is you ubisoft doubt id buy any game with your name on it ever again even sadder that you boast u spent 3 years developing the game and yet a simple fix would have been nice the game is ac3 and as a result the completionist trophy is unattainable thanks to this issue i just got assassins creed black flag and it asks me to enter a number from the authentication app but i dont have any authentication app so i find the app and install it but it still doesnt work because i have no bar code to active the new account after a lot of hunting forums and such i found that when this 2 step login is activated i should be sent some recovery codes in case i break the authentication problem is i have no codes so no way to log in and get the game to work i was able to log in to my account on one of the ubisoft sites using just the normal password system i couldnt get to the management of my account and  turn the 2 step crap off cause it asked me to enter the authentication number  but i did raise a ticket to try and get them to turn it off other than an automated email acknowledgement  ive had nothing in 2 days i spent all night downloading tom clancy wildlands i have slowish internet 40 something gbs and it forgets all of it i cant say too much more because of the rage i feel towards ubisoft and its uplay designers please please fire your current personnel and sell yourselves to steam there are many more problems such as when i called your help line it said it wasnt a valid number then i googled it and that one had a fax going through i tried to get help from you directly you did not leave me any option so in my anger im writing this since you wouldnt help me like your games though i cant begin to explain to you what massive jerks these people are my account got hacked and i came to them with proof in fact they emailed me someone was trying to change my infothe rep was dismissive told me i was wrong and needed to contact steam told me my account was hacked but i didnt seem to understand that it wasnt their problem they blamed steam when i havent used steam in almost a year and all in all it will have to be a hell of a title for me to ever purchase anything from them ever again and if there was a just world they would all forever be stuck on loading screens i have never been treated as poorly as ubisoft treats their peoplei worked in customer care for almost 10 years i would never treat my customers that wayi am shocked i have been treated like crap before but just dismissed in not only an unprofessional manner but just plain dismissive manner that is new to meso get hacked your faultbuy a game and then find out they lied your faultask for help get sent to someone else for another queue all in all ubisoft i am donecheersdont do anything i would doalso fire aaron w sold games are completely different from what they show us at e3 when i heard that they created uplay to try and compete with steam i almost died  from laughter the offering games campaign is just to try and make you download garbageplay on your pc not only uplay but games are full of bugs glitches and every single thing that they release is unplayable currently competing with ea for worst company and let me tell you i never felt better hearing that all i want to do is play a game and every single time there is something wrong either it is their stupid 2 step verification their crappy servers are down again or my account just doesnt work when i try and solve it just goes down to talking to the people at head office who never seem to have a shift longer then two minutes and then you just cant play any more the games are brilliant if you can play them sort it out ubisoft bought a game for my son 16 from cdkeyscom  it was for him to play via uplay he usually uses steam with no problem   after 2 days of playing the game uplay have blocked his access saying code is already in use and he has to buy code again   ive tried to contact this company 3 times in last week through various methods  absolutely no contact from this bunch of clowns  how these people are still in business is beyond me looking at similar complaints from others   needless to say i shall be avoiding this company with a large bargepole from now on terrible bit of software sits between you and your game like steam except badly implemented and greedy\\nits got to the stage where ive stopped buying games that use uplay bought rainbow six seige got banned by fairfight for no reason so i wrote a ticket after 2 weeks still no response there is no game on this earth that i would want to buy on uplay i refuse to use this always online drm plus they legitimately treat everyone on pc like garbage with the excuse they are all pirates which is your excuse for making lackluster and absolutely terrible ports that is all it is though a meaningless excuse never ever use this ever found out someone was using my email address for an account when i got a password reset email i reset the password took over the account and went on the support section to inform them of the fraud after 4 weeks of trying i can no longer log in and not a single person has contacted me regarding it i used to be able to play rainbow six siege but everything changed when the uplay servers attacked ubisoft the master of all rainbow six games was the only one who could bring balance to the servers but when we needed them most they vanished theres no other way to say it but this ubisoft has a horrible client with horrible customer service the fact that the only way to contact them is through email is just completely stupid i cant even log into mine or recover my password for it because it keeps telling me that my account is suspended due to multiple log in attempts when i try to send a ticket to figure out the issue its unable to submit the question at that time i try later same thing so i try to create a new account cant do it its stupidive been trying for over an hour tonight just to play one game all my uplay saves were deleted multiple times because i had to reinstall uplay syncing didnt work because the servers were apparently down for a few weeks for no legitimate reason no option for manual sync no option to move default saves folder which is in program files which any idiot who has spent more than 5 minutes developing software can tell you is a bad idea bulky provides no functionality that isnt already done better by steam or even dare i say origin and is an otherwise useless wrapper to games that are probably already rife with their own monumental design flaws as they all are developed by ubisoft uplay is terrible piece of software and knowing that i will have to use it with any future ubisoft games i play means that i wont be purchasing any more ubi games any time in the near future i hate uplay got couple games on steam that needs uplay to play it awful expedience my uplay account banned for 10 minutes for couple login attempts i changed my password waited 2030 mins but anyway cant login wasted some money for games and cant even play it i hate you uplay ubisoft really need to ditch uplay its terrible stay away from uplay if you have a problem your really up a creek i had assins creed brother hood and far cry three on my account i have only two witch was the same username since i created the account not changed and with my main email i contacted them and he saying the user name was jacker\\nthis is such bull and the other username on my other account was not changed neither the one matching what he quoted i demanded a new key off them but he kept saying return and ask for refund too late for that cheeky shts this site needs to be taken down let steam do the job witch are more trust worthy ubisoft needs to either completely rehaul uplay or abandon it altogether ubisoft create some amazing games 1010 and then bring the gameplay down to 110 when you have to use uplay with all there games its not that bad exept the online mode does not work 99 of the time when the online mode doesnt work you cant play with friends when you cant play with friends you get mad when you get mad you throw your game controller when you throw your game controller you break your monitor when you break your monitor you have to buy a new one and cant play games on till the new one arives dont stop playing video games stop using uplay really really bad customer service havent experienced as bad as this for years trying to move a cd key i bought over a month ago to the correct email account since i wrongly entered an wrong email with typo on their excellent uplay play software\\n\\nheard from them first time after a month that they cannot move the cd key to the correct email even though i have sent them the cd key verification from my steam account and i told the the account name of the wrongly entered email which it should be moved from within 10 minutes of creating the wrong account on uplay\\n\\nnever doing business with uplay again day 5 still with no respond from customer service after i received a faulty download code uplay is the biggest pile of s that you will ever meet dont ever ever under any circumstances try to use it else it will f up your head with so much pain and confusion i had to deal with losing my entire ac4 saves after uplay botched them all up countless times i had to replay the story from the beginning three times and it was awful i loved the game but uplay just needs to die i was so excited for far cry 4 but of course it uses uplay too im seriously considering not getting the game uplay ruined ac4 for me and i dont want that to happen with far cry 4 if ubisoft is reading this please stop using uplay just abandon it why do you try so hard lets start at the beginning uplay requires you to type in your product key which it may or may not accept for every game sometimes uplay will forget and want you to type it in again which you cant since it has already been used once\\n\\nif you manage you get to the point of starting a game without the many installation errors you still more than likely wont be able to play it depends on what mood uplay is in out of the 2 weeks i had far cry 3 installed uplay privileged me to be able to play it 4 of those days how generous \\n\\noh worried about someone trying to steal your account dont worry if you mistype your usernamepassword even once uplay will sometimes ban your account for an hour so you dont have to waste your time trying to manage with this broken program\\n\\nits much less of a hassle and stress to just pirate the games instead of having to deal with uplay uplay is a very unknown onlinestarter for example watch_dogs because of nvidia uplay is more known nvidia gave you a license key for watch_dogs when you bought a graphics card 660 series and higher and i even got my 660 and i was hoping and thinking nvidia was using the key on steam or origin but nope they did use the most unknown game shop only because of nvidia everybody knows about uplay\\n\\nto my review uplay has a nice design a unig system but the start menu when you login should be your game liberty \\nwhen you transfer games from disk to disk nope you arnt able to do that when you download a game from uplay they are somehow making windows able to use 13 gb in 3 seconds so they are somehow allocating the use of gigabytes the game need that is very bad made \\nthe transfer thing is really gonna get fixed else uplay would suck more because if im suppose to download 25 gb to 3 computers then im gonna wait long time to play\\ni hate uplay and i dont like it at all nvidia should have choose steam or origin for watch_dogs we had origin we had games for windows live and now ubisoft bugs gamers with the same bullshit once again\\n\\nif you want to make such a program atleast make it work\\n\\nits so buggy that it sometimes makes games completly unplayable but still the largest problem is the fact that have to use the client \\n\\ni still dont understand why ubisoft havent updated steam games so uplay integration is more painless i would be less angry if ubisoft didnt have to run both clients at the same time just make me run uplay once for registration and such and then let me choose to use steam from then on create a hybrid model or something for christ sake they install programs that put your security at risk and every game ive played thats required uplay has had severe problems such as losing 8 hours of game play on black flag which after some research is a widespread problem caused by uplay and the only way to fix it so far is to download a crack from torrent sites its got to be embarrassing when pirates have to fix your game for you i love your games but i hate your ubisoft connect it is horrible it always has been horrible its slow and very laggy and it crashes games or freezes both on xbox and playstation and i believe it needs to be fixed for fully optimized gameplay ubisoft is a game company that develops their games with copy and paste from their previous work not only are they lazy but they seemingly dont care about their bugs and gltiches theres so much glitches that i am not satisfied with my money spent on these games to be honest they need to change the way of thinking when making a game otherwise ubisoft will not compete with others i include games that frequently have the same enginemechanics whatsoever watch dogs far cry tom clancyfar cry and watch dogs need a new mechanic its all the same boring task with new glitches over and over till you end the game of disappointment the game library is worth is it if you are into ubisoft games however the fact that if internet connection is somehow lost even for 1 minute the game shuts off and all progress is lost with it as well which is bsi understand that ubisoft plus is a live service and requires an internet connection to launch games but internet interruptions can exist and for a 150gb offline single player game this shouldnt be a problem at least have the timeout set to a decent 15 instead of instant disconnect the moment my isp decides to break my internetive been a ubisoft plus user for more than 2 years but after valhalla i am considering dropping the subscription for this exact reason it is not the first time this has happened to me and i have grown tired of it terrible app bought one game what a disaster i will make sure to buy games on steam from now on  activation keys cant be found on the app and support tech people cant find the solution   they should pay me for the grief they cause i had just gotten a new game far cry primal and it will say there is a problem authentication the ownership of this game but when i go to get help it will not list the game and i have no idea why since it is one of their games i just want to play my game and fix this horrible mess that your system has caused i just got ghost recon and its full of bugs and crashes every time i try to change my configuration its bull crap for a 50 game and now that i see the reviews it looks like its nit going to get fixed so gamer be were came here for rainbow six siege this game is becoming a waste of time to play xbox one my hits arent registering too many hackers shield operators seem like their shields are made of cardboard because they arent even slowing bullets down i can empty a mag on somebody and they seem to be fine i get killed in 3 shots and 2 of them missed me the game  needs to be fixed before you worry about more operators preordered a game but later found the release date was listed wrong live chat said sorry for the misinformation were fixing it now but we cant refund you this was my 1st no pireted game  was paying 99bucks for a gold edition  but their pettinesses left a bitter taste and i wont be buying from them again the date is 2 weeks later then what was discribed onthier website  and well i could of really used that money  just preordered 2 days before the advertised release date to get the preorder goodies  which i have to admit are a bit lacking but i really liked watch dogs 1 downloaded torrent and i will go back to just doing  that good games bad infrastructure their website and launcher is really buggy its ok games they make are good the store i dont like nor go there for nothing but installing and playing my gameswith tom clanys breakpoint what really frustrates me is that if their server is unreachable i cannot play once it even kicked me out while already playing single player going offline doesnt help just cant play thats really bad this company doesnt even make good games anymore stop buying things from themubisoft_customer_support_1__855_2982507__ubisoft_customer_support_1__855_2982507__ubisoft_customer_support_1__855_2982507__ubisoft_customer_support_1__855_2982507__ubisoft_customer_support_1__855_2982507__ubisoft_customer_support_1__855_2982507__ubisoft_customer_support_1__855_2982507__ubisoft_customer_support_1__855_2982507__ubisoft_customer_support_1__855_2982507__best part is they could release the best game ever now and i still wouldnt buy it because i want this company to go down so badi guess they get the epic treatment from got my account hijacked today spent over 200 hours each game and 120 on the account i go to support and guess what they cant do anythinggo fk youre selfs ubisoft you nasty cnts too underrated most people who write reviews about this are talking about losing their ghost recon account or yada yada its a really good app and i have been on it for years unlike other people here who keeps on posting stuff about troubles with payment i just want to let everybody else know that i had no troubles making a purchase once i clicked on checkout i got charged and got the game immediately thanks uplay is not bad its like steam and other types of launchers or game stores so why do you people hate it so much i only played a few games so maybe thats why i dont think uplay is bad'"
